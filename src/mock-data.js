          "The Broken Kilometer, 1979, located at 393 West Broadway in New York City, is composed of 500 highly polished, round, solid brass rods, each measuring two meters in length and five centimeters (two inches) in diameter. The 500 rods are placed in five parallel rows of 100 rods each. The sculpture weighs 18 3/4 tons and would measure 3,280 feet if all the elements were laid end-to-end. Each rod is placed such that the spaces between the rods increase by 5mm with each consecutive space, from front to back; the first two rods of each row are placed 80mm apart, the last two rods are placed 580 mm apart. Metal halide stadium lights illuminate the work which is 45 feet wide and 125 feet long.\r\n\r\nThis work is the companion piece to De Maria's 1977 Vertical Earth Kilometer at Kassel, Germany. In that permanently installed earth sculpture, a brass rod of the same diameter, total weight and total length has been inserted 1,000 meters into the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Broken Kilometer has been on long-term view to the public since 1979. This work was commissioned and is maintained by Dia Art Foundation.\r\n\r\nAll images of The Broken Kilometer are copyright Dia Art Foundation and may not be reproduced in any form without written permission from Dia Art Foundation. photo credit: Jon Abbott\r\n"

          "92YTribeca presents the works of Rachel Beach and Nicole Stager – both formerly shown at Like the Spice gallery in Brooklyn – in an opening reception for this semi-permanent exhibit.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn-dwelling, Ontario-born Rachel Beach creates works that have been described as “tough, precise and disciplined with a hard edged cheeriness.” Her wall-mounted sculptures – wooden portals and towers – rest on the border “between sculpture and painting, illusion and reality, masculine and feminine, representation, abstraction and decoration.” The portals literally take on the idea of a window, framing a section of wall or empty space in the gallery; the towers are architectural but can also seem at times like freestanding ornament. Each of these sculpture/paintings is designed to alter our visual perception of three-dimensional form.\r\n\r\nNicole Stager creates her work in the darkroom, drawing with handheld light sources in a process that combines the specificity of photography with the aesthetic of abstract painting. Time, color, shape and line are all uniquely presented in Stager’s work; the final product has far more to do with the interaction of light, shadow and chemistry than with the objects that produced them. A native of Pennsylvania, Stager is currently completing her MFA in New Media from the Transart Instituta at Danube University in Krems, Austria.\r\n\r\n "

          "The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) houses one of the world’s great cultural resources, with collections representing the Native peoples of the Americas from their earliest history to the present day. Infinity of Nations presents more than two hundred of these works chosen from nearly seven hundred objects of cultural, historical, and aesthetic importance on view at the museum’s George Gustav Heye Center in New York. The objects shown here include an exquisite Olmec jade head that dates to between 900 and 600 BC; a superb Moche–Huari tunic (AD 700 to 900); an unparalleled Mexica (Aztec) sculpture of a maize goddess (ca. AD 1500); an exceptionally rare late-18th-century Anishnaabe man’s outfit, and a disquieting sculpture titled Sleeping Man by contemporary artist Bob Hauzous (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache).\r\n\r\nIn a departure for the museum, Infinity of Nations is organized geographically. Central to the exhibition are fifty objects highlighted within the regional sections, with brief descriptions written by an impressive new generation of Native scholars and community knowledge-keepers. Many of these iconic objects, like the Diné (Navajo) first phase chief blanket, speak to a people’s history and culture at a certain point in time. Several highlighted objects are associated with prominent Native individuals. Still others, like the pottery plate and candleholders from the mission church at the ancestral A:shiwi (Zuni) village of Hawikku, represent encounters between Natives and non-Natives or moments pivotal in Native history.\r\n\r\nTen singular examples serve as regional focal points. The more detailed expositions of these objects, including a magnificent Apsáalooke (Crow) warrior’s exploit robe and an impressive Maya limestone bas-relief depicting a ball player, further demonstrate the degree to which Native cultures were interconnected long before European peoples arrived in the Americas, and how Native peoples and Europeans together made more recent history.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of Infinity of Nations looks at contemporary Native art as a medium for exploring Native experiences and ideas. Throughout, the exhibition illustrates how objects in the museum’s collections can serve as points of entry to understanding other cultures and times."

          "As part of its on-going stairwell project, The Drawing Center has commissioned American artist Gary Simmons to create a site-specific wall drawing in the lobby stairwell. Simmons’ installation will be the second in the series following Abdelkader Benchamma’s Representation of Dark Matter (April 2015 – August 2016). \r\n\r\nMining the iconography of American popular culture, Gary Simmons’s work addresses personal and collective experiences of race and class. He is best known for his “erasure drawings,” which he began working on in the late 1980s in an abandoned school in New York City that contained an abundance of blackboards. Using white chalk on slate-painted panels or walls, Simmons blurred the drawings with his hands resulting in hazy but persistent images that evoke faded memories or classrooms at the end of the school day. For The Drawing Center, Simmons will create a text-based work consisting of names of African American actors and actresses from the early days of silent film. The artist describes the installation, whose format recalls the scrolling of closing film credits frozen in mid-motion, as invoking “the memories of actors that have been blurred in the history of Hollywood film … a kind of silence in both voice and visibility.”\r\n\r\nCurated by Claire Gilman, Senior Curator\r\n\r\n"

          "Fisher Landau Center for Art presents the presentation of Hypothetical? Lorna Simpson’s sound installation including text, a photograph and mouthpieces from wind instruments. First shown in 1993 at the Whitney Biennial, the artwork was purchased directly from the exhibition and has not been on view since her retrospective traveled throughout the United States from 2006-07, organized by the American Federation of Arts.\r\n\r\nAs David Kiehl wrote in his 2010 catalogue essay for LEGACY: The Emily Fisher Landau Collection : “…It takes its title from a framed newspaper excerpt regarding a question posed to Tom Bradley, the African American mayor of Los Angeles, in the wake of the city’s riots following the April, 1992 acquittal of the LAPD officers charged with beating African American motorist Rodney King. Asked if whether he would now be afraid to be a black man in Los Angeles if he were not the mayor, Mr. Bradley paused, then said: “No, I would not be scared. I would be angry.” Hypothetical emerged as a pivotal moment in Simpson’s artwork, creating a physical space where the viewers become active participants. This signaled a major shift from her two-dimensional photo pieces incorporating text, to her first forays into installation based environments. The aural component of Hypothetical is inspired by the constraints of spoken language: silent mouthpieces from wind instruments are installed directly into the wall as sculptural forms, accompanied by hidden speakers projecting the muted sound of labored breathing as if struggling to reach a cohesive melody.\r\nAlong one wall of the Center’s first floor gallery are several of Simpson’s “phototext” pieces made between 1990-91 including Outline and Queensize, which directly precede Hypothetical? This combination of imagery and language serves to question the role that photography had played up until that point in time. The camera ceased to be a documentary device, becoming a means of investigative observation that combined seeing and reading. Regarding Queensize Simpson recalled “…It occurred to me that the modern fascination with African masks involved the front of a mask and its formal, geometric qualities. But the idea of contemplating the mask from behind brings the viewer closer to the cultural involvement that the mask represents. It speaks of a participatory ritual or performance.” (LEGACY: The Emily Fisher Landau Collection, Whitney Museum of American Art, published by Yale University Press, 2010)."

          "A “high-fidelity” interpretation of the De Stijl art movement’s iconic combination of geometric forms and primary colors, Olalekan Jeyifous’s café installation is palpably playful. With bright, elementary colors and large geometric structures, the work visually evokes the architecture of a playground or a child’s building blocks. In the simplest sections of the mural, affixations between structures are visible and obvious. Yet these simple connectors are adjoined to more sophisticated buildings where hinges, bolts, and wheels disappear and masterly architecture is introduced. Described by Jeyifous as a mash up of invented architecture and vintage stereo design, Hifi De Stijl’s imaginative landscape feels at once recognizable and fantastical.\r\n\r\nSeeped in the eco-political ideology and activism of “solarpunk,” Jeyifous creates large-scale digital renderings that translate the existing architectural language of neighborhoods into colossal vertical settlements. In addition to digital art, Jeyifous works in sculpture, photography, and pencil. His work has been shown in group exhibitions at The Studio Museum in Harlem, The Kitchen, the New Museum, Socrates Sculpture Park, and the Museum of Modern Art, all in NY. He has shown internationally at the Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, Germany, and the Guggenheim Bilbao, Spain. Jeyifous is the recipient of numerous residencies and fellowships, including those from Socrates Sculpture Park, The Drawing Center, Headlands Center for the Arts, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, and the MacDowell Colony. He has also worked as a senior designer for the communications agency DBOX. Jeyifous holds a BFA in Architecture from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.\r\n\r\nThe café features a rotation of large-scale commissioned murals that envelop the first floor café space.\r\n"

          "Main Gallery, Drawing Room\r\n\r\nThe Drawing Center presents Exploratory Works: Drawings from the Department of Tropical Research Field Expeditions, an exhibition examining the images produced by the Department of Tropical Research (DTR) during their pioneering ecological expeditions to South America and the Caribbean in the first half of the 20th century. Sixty historical drawings produced by a variety of artists in collaboration with the DTR’s scientists will be exhibited for the first time, alongside two new major installations by artist Mark Dion, which will recreate with great detail the DTR’s field labs for both their jungle and aquatic missions. Co-organized by Dion; historian and anthropologist Katherine McLeod; and Madeleine Thompson, institutional archivist at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, Exploratory Works highlights a seminal moment when art advanced our understanding of science, and in turn science trusted the intuition of the artist to show us something as-of-yet unimaginable.\r\n \r\nThe Ground-Breaking Work of the Department of Tropical Research\r\nLed by biologist Charles William Beebe (1877–1962) of the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society), the DTR focused their studies around what today would be described as tropical rainforest and marine ecology. Throughout their expeditions, Beebe and his team of scientists worked side by side with artists to illustrate the ecosystems they researched. At a time when photographic technologies were limited, the artists of the DTR used their pens and brushes to construct visualizations of natural environments that were difficult or impossible to access. The DTR’s innovative use of drawings, sketches, paintings, cartoons, animations, and films helped make the idea of an interconnected ecosystem part of popular and scientific thought.  \r\n \r\nUnder Beebe’s guidance, the DTR also instituted the revolutionary practice of hiring women as lead scientists and field artists. Through this professional platform, the DTR enabled the careers of, among others, scientists Jocelyn Crane and Gloria Hollister, and artists Else Bostelmann, Helen Tee-Van, and Isabel Cooper.\r\n \r\nRecreating the Labs of the DTR\r\nAs part of Exploratory Works, co-organizer and artist Mark Dion will construct two installations that will bring to life the interiors of the DTR’s field stations. While one of the installations will develop the space of the jungle laboratories, the other will look to the oceanographic workshops. Using numerous archival images that depict the interior conditions of these labs, Dion’s installations will capture the material culture of science at the time and emphasize the extraordinary situation of artists and scientists working together. Dion will also produce a display cabinet with glass-covered pull out drawers, shelving, and vitrines to exhibit the rich archival material of the DTR. These reconstructions build on the foundation of installation art Dion has practiced in museums, galleries, and public institutions worldwide, as well as his keen knowledge of the history of field biology for the period and its related material culture.\r\n \r\nABOUT THE CURATORS\r\nMARK DION\r\nBorn in 1961 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, artist Mark Dion examines the ways in which dominant ideologies and public institutions shape our understanding of history, knowledge, and the natural world. Appropriating archaeological, field ecology, and other scientific methods of collecting, ordering, and exhibiting objects, Dion creates works that question the distinctions between “objective” (“rational”) scientific methods and “subjective” (“irrational”) influences. Dion has received numerous awards including the Joan Mitchell Foundation Award (2007) and the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s Lucida Art Award (2008),  and has had major exhibitions at the British Museum of Natural History in London (2007), the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2004) and the Tate Gallery, London (1999), among others.\r\n \r\nKATHERINE MCLEOD\r\nKatherine McLeod is an environmental historian and anthropologist. Her research focuses on the workings of land, labor, and capital in relation to U.S. scientific practices in South America and the Caribbean during the 20th and 21st centuries.\r\n \r\nMADELEINE THOMPSON\r\nMadeleine Thompson is the Institutional Archivist for the Wildlife Conservation Society.  In this role, she works to preserve and share the rich history of WCS, which began in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society. Among her interests are theories of collecting and the histories of wildlife conservation and popular science."

          "Peter Blum presents the gallery’s first exhibition of works by the Swiss artist Sonja Sekula (1918–1963) titled A Survey.\r\n \r\nWhile many of her male counterparts gained wide notoriety during their lifetime, Sonja Sekula has not been fully recognized for her active role and unique voice within the seminal art movements of the mid-20th century.  A Survey consists of a select group of paintings and works on paper that span Sekula’s short but prolific career (1942-1963).\r\n \r\nSonja Sekula was born in Lucerne, Switzerland, to a Hungarian father and Swiss mother. In 1936, the family moved to New York, where at the age of eighteen Sekula began her studies in art, philosophy and literature at Sarah Lawrence College. In 1941, she also attended the Art Students League and studied under Morris Kantor and Raphael Soyer.\r\n\r\nIn her mid-twenties, Sekula was heavily involved with the New York surrealists (briefly sharing an apartment on 56th Street with André Breton), as well as the emerging group of abstract expressionists—among her friends and collaborators were Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Robert Motherwell.  Sekula had several one-person exhibitions at Betty Parsons gallery from 1948–1960 and was included in exhibitions at Peggy Guggenheim’s gallery, Art of This Century. Like her contemporaries, Sekula’s work at this time was heavily influenced by American Indian culture, mythologies, and visual motifs.  Her works in the 1940’s were an amalgamation of biomorphic forms, “primitive” figuration, with painterly European modernism.  In the 1950’s and early 60’s Sekula began to develop an unconstrained personal style.  During this period her works employed an automatic and lyrical form of mark making that related most closely to avant-garde music and prevailing modes of composition.  Sekula was acquainted with John Cage, Morton Feldman, and designed costumes for Merce Cunningham. \r\n \r\nSonja Sekula’s style expressed a poignant emotional quality that perhaps alluded to her internal life.  The poetic titles of her works, such as “The heart is a bit sad” and “one of these rare hours” are written directly on the surface of the paintings and works on paper, opening a window into the artist’s fragile psychological state.  Sekula was in and out of mental institutions throughout adulthood—sadly leading to her taking her own life in 1963 at the age of 45 in Zurich.  We are privileged to have the opportunity to show the works of this undeniable talent.\r\n\r\nSonja Sekula was born in 1918 in Lucerne and died in 1963 in Zurich, Switzerland. Selected solo exhibitions include: Kunstmuseum Lucerne, Switzerland (2016) Swiss Institute, New York, NY (1996); Kunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland (1996); Betty Parsons, New York, NY ( 1948-1952); Peggy Guggenheim’s Art of This Century (1946);  Group exhibitions include: NO EXIT, Peter Blum Gallery, New York, NY(2017); Pennsylvania Acadamy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA (2011); Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Ireland (2010; Dunkelschwestern, Aargauer Kunsthaus, Aarau, Switzerland (2008); Kunstmuseum Winterthur (1995);  The Whitney Museum, New York, NY (1956); Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN (1954); The Art Institute of Chicago (1952); San Francsisco Museum of Art (1952); The Brooklyn Museum (1949, 1951); The Metropolitan Museum of Art (1950)."

          "Hauser &amp; Wirth presents the US debut of four new bodies of work by acclaimed American artist Roni Horn. The exhibition features the photographic opus ‘The Selected Gifts (1974 – 2015)’, a collection of 67 photographs documenting the history of gifts the artist received over a period of 41 years. Also on view are two new bodies of works on paper, The Dog’s Chorus (2016) – shown here for the first time – and Th Rose Prblm (2015), as well as the new glass sculptures ‘Water Double, v. 1’ and ‘Water Double, v. 3’ (both 2013 – 2015). Although materially divergent, these works all derive from longstanding questions and themes that have propelled Horn’s practice and her ongoing poetic study of the protean nature of identity, meaning, and perception.\r\n\r\nA fossilized dinosaur egg, leather gloves, two copies of Djuna Barnes’ ‘The Book of Repulsive Women’, and a handmade olive tree are but a few of the objects that appear in ‘The Selected Gifts (1974 – 2015)’ – the majority of which are reproduced at actual size. Photographed with a deceptively affectless approach that belies sentimental value, Horn’s collected treasures oat against pristine white backdrops in the artist’s signature serial style. Together, the sundry gifts tell a story of the self as mediated through both objects and others – what the artist calls ‘a vicarious self-portrait.’ Horn explains, ‘It is a reflection through the warped optic of others that shows a level of accuracy beyond that of any mirror. A portrait I could not have imagined without the unwitting aid of friends, acquaintances, and knowing strangers.’\r\n\r\nEmbedded in ‘The Selected Gifts (1974 – 2015)’ is not only the passage of time – the earliest gift harks back to 1974 – but also the implication of collaboration, albeit unknowing, between recipient and the gift givers, whose identities remain a mystery to viewers. Horn’s process of sifting through and selecting from her unruly collection of objects further shapes her self-portrait. Laced with humor, ‘The Selected Gifts (1974 – 2015)’ elicits questions about the contingent nature of meaning and identity, a theme situated at the very core of Horn’s art. A chimerical portrayal emerges as the installation unfolds; the myriad objects coalesce into a kaleidoscopic account of the self. ‘The Selected Gifts (1974 – 2015)’ builds upon earlier works by Horn that utilize similar conceptual approaches, including ‘My Gifts, A Selection (1960-2015)’, a chapbook that itemizes gifts the artist received over a span of 55 years, and ‘67 Postcards, A Selection’, a text from 2011 that describes and transcribes all 67 postcard images and captions. The latter is a direct predecessor to ‘The Selected Gifts, (1974 – 2015)’ and has recently been expanded into a limited-edition artist book, ‘82 Postcards’, co-published by Hauser &amp; Wirth Publishers and Steidl.\r\n\r\nUnfolding over adjacent gallery spaces, two new major series of drawings similarly weigh humor with larger questions about the fluidity of meaning and identity. The Dog’s Chorus and Th Rose Prblm expand upon the intricate, labor-intensive approach to drawing that Horn has developed since the early 1980s. Beginning with an arguably destructive act, Horn uses a Stanley knife to slice up an original drawing; this act is itself a form of line making. She then reassembles the fragments into something new, creating pulsating grounds that appear tangled. These craggy-edged works are their own islands of incident, where highly tessellated surfaces testify to a meticulous process of creation. Literature has long been a central element in Horn’s oeuvre, where the words of such figures as Emily Dickinson become the artist’s materials. In The Dog’s Chorus, lines from Shakespeare’s ‘Julius Caesar’ merge with common everyday idioms – trite, hackneyed turns of phrase familiar from daily life – and are rendered in rich colors. In bringing together these ‘high’ and ‘low’ forms of language, the artist playfully dislodges texts from their traditional cultural dwelling places, deconstructing and reconstructing language and meaning just as she does physical materials. Her strategically scattered words disintegrate into an almost pixilated chaos.\r\n\r\nFollowing a similar approach for Th Rose Prblm, Horn cuts together two well-worn phrases: ‘Rose is a rose is a rose’ or ‘a rose is a rose is a rose’, with ‘come up smelling like roses’ or ‘coming up smelling like a rose’. Horn further sharpens her conceptual approach to language here, splicing these expressions together in all their possible iterations. Employing what she calls ‘downright dumb humor,’ this series also makes sense from nonsense. As Horn explains, ‘I was interested in the idea of rearranging these phrases into all the possible outcomes. I see it as a metaphor for identity. There are 48 drawings and I’m thinking of it as one work. So cumulatively the shades of meaning obtain a complexity and range that stand in for the mutable, changeable nature of identity.’ The complex, maze-like compositions set Horn’s surfaces into motion.\r\n\r\nThe Hauser &amp; Wirth exhibition offers visitors vivid access to Horn’s extraordinary process, a method of drawing that she has described as ‘a kind of breathing activity on a daily level’. For Horn, drawing is ‘the form I feel closest to. It may be my true native language.’ Realized through an active act of excavation, Horn’s drawings suggest enormous attention and time – and thus demand the same from viewers. The notion of doubling, important across her oeuvre, is also at play here in a temporal sense: ‘Each drawing is at once itself and the trace of itself,’ she notes. Past and present oscillate as trace and presence, and the artist’s nearly sculptural approach speaks to her interest in the metaphysics of experience.\r\n\r\nNowhere is this interest more palpable than in Horn’s iconic cast glass sculptures. The exhibition at Hauser &amp; Wirth concludes with two of the largest Horn has ever produced: ‘Water Double, v. 1’ and ‘Water Double, v. 3’. While these hulking cylinders appear to be adamantly solid forms, they are actually in imperceptible motion: Glass is neither liquid nor solid, but an amorphous liquid solid that exists between those two states of matter, with atoms moving too slowly for its condition of constant change to be visible. By virtue of this extraordinary duality, glass is an ideal medium for Horn’s exploration of the shifting grounds of meaning and identity. Each of her two new sculptures on view is comprised of two parts that are separated yet palpably connected, proffering us an invitation to contemplate easy, accepted notions of ‘likeness’ and ‘difference’. Reflecting the changing natural light, these works partner with the weather and the constant cycles of time that we measure in days; they mirror our mercurial and unsteady standards of perception. Horn’s enigmatic and insistently present forms are each topped with an oculus. These translucent and highly reflective ‘pools’ of glass act as receptacles for reflections, accumulating snippets of their surroundings in an array of fragments that recall the splintered surfaces of Horn’s drawings. Elegant and deceptively simple, Horn’s forms are in fact extraordinarily ambitious feats of production that upon completion remain open-ended and defy straightforward experience. As ever with Horn, what you see is not necessarily what you get.\r\n\r\nAbout the Artist\r\n\r\nRoni Horn was born in 1955 and lives and works in New York NY. Recent solo exhibitions include ‘Roni Horn’, Fondation Beyeler, Riehen/Basel, Switzerland (2016); ‘Roni Horn’, de Pont Museum, Tilburg, Netherlands (2016); ‘Roni Horn. Butter y to Oblivion’, Fondation Vincent van Gogh, Arles, France (2015); ‘Roni Horn.

        "Description": [
          "Hauser &amp; Wirth presents an exhibition offering rare insights into the central role that books played in the remarkably diverse artistic practice of legendary German-born Swiss artist Dieter Roth (1930 – 1998).\r\n\r\nFueled by artistic restlessness, Roth’s wildly experimental approach to drawing, printing, and book making eventually found its way into ambitious large-scale sculptural installations, many conceived and executed in collaboration with his son Björn Roth. The exhibition at Hauser &amp; Wirth presents ‘The Studio of Dieter and Björn Roth, Ackermannshof, Basel’ (1995 – 2008), an installation of the actual studio in Basel, Switzerland, shared by the father and son artmaking team, that includes furniture, books, and an array of personal items reflecting not just the Roths’ practice but a defining philosophy in which art and daily life are indivisible. In seeking to pulverize traditional boundaries, Dieter Roth elevated the processes by which things happen, embracing accidents, mutations, and accretions of detail over time. Hence the second major installation project ‘Flacher Abfall (Flat Waste)’ (1975 – 1976/1992) comprises commercial packaging, printed paper material and other daily studio detritus that highlights the banality of the everyday, led in plastic sleeves in over 600 binders.\r\n\r\n‘Books. Dieter Roth. Björn Roth. Studio’ will be on view at Hauser &amp; Wirth’s 22nd Street space through 29 July 2017.\r\n\r\nStudio\r\n\r\nFor Roth the studio was not merely a locale, but also a concept of ultimate, central meaning. In this space, he de ned a physical and intellectual territory in which to develop a wide-ranging, life-encompassing, unfettered body of work. ‘The Studio of Dieter and Björn Roth, Ackermannschof, Basel’ (1995 – 2008), a re-installation of the artist’s St. Johanns Vorstadt studio in Basel, is the embodiment of this imperative. Following Dieter’s death, his son and long-time collaborator Björn decided to preserve the space where they had worked together from 1995. So, upon vacating the studio, Björn packed up and catalogued every single object – including furniture, books, pens, and personal items – to install as a work of art elsewhere. Through art, objects, and atmosphere, the studio is a living cosmos into which visitors become incorporated, enveloped in the active spirit of the artist. Björn Roth recalls, ‘I don’t think the word ‘art’ was ever used. The studio was inventory, and the works were material. ‘Now we have to root around in the inventory,’ he’d say when the time had come to work on something from our studios.’\r\n\r\nThe exhibition also includes a series of gestural paintings by Björn Roth, with intricate layers of translucent oil paint washed on top of photographs of the Studio. Presented alongside ‘The Studio of Dieter and Björn Roth, Ackermannschof, Basel’, they highlight the artistic legacy of Dieter Roth as it lives on in the continued evolution of his collaborative works and the creative practice of his son.\r\n\r\nFlacher Abfall / Flat Waste\r\n\r\nNot one to tolerate boundaries, Dieter Roth avidly collected the traces of everyday life to incorporate into his work, which in turn is replete with archival accumulation. His copious diaries reveal the synoptic graphic universe Roth inhabited and expanded. In the mid-1970s, he attempted to record a year of his life by collecting and preserving all items of daily detritus less than five mm thick. The resulting opus, ‘Flacher Abfall / Flat Waste’ (1975 – 1976), celebrates and subverts the ordering principle of a diary. Encased in over 600 binders that ll multiple bookshelves, things ordinarily discarded – such as old food wrappers, receipts, and other traces of daily activity – are carefully preserved. What began as assemblages of at waste expanded into a monumental work, a combination of an autobiographical record and an environment in which the viewer is forced to confront the ephemeral nature of existence through exposure to the collection of garbage.\r\n\r\nBooks\r\n\r\nFrom conception to production, Dieter Roth’s artist’s books are immensely rich and varied in both context and design. The range of his unrestrained experimentation is evident in an array of works on view, from the rst abstract geometrical books of the early 1950s, to the book objects in the 1960s, to his Copy Books (first published in 1977), volumes of omnifarious photocopied materials, to his more intimate journals, which contain a handwritten surge of personal thoughts interspersed with linear drawings, doodles, and sketches. Roth’s experimental drawings series expanded upon these amalgamations, many of which were then produced in editions or in book form.\r\n\r\nComprised of original handwritten texts fused with geometrical and figurative drawings, ‘246 little clouds’ (1968), reprinted in 1976 as volume 17 of the Collected Works, was the rst of Dieter Roth’s poetry volumes published in English. Presented here for the rst time, and shown alongside, are original scripts and handwritten instructions related to both versions.\r\n\r\nTaking its title from James Joyce’s short story ‘A Little Cloud’, Roth’s Cloud series is a stunning expression of his deft and original approach to bookmaking. When his works were photographed for printing this volume, the artist instructed that each page be lit from the right, but that the light be moved sequentially for each page to yield an effect like the movement of the sun. Roth would often collaborate with other artists in order to subvert the principle of authorship and to annihilate categories and hierarchies in his work. His ‘246 little clouds’ is introduced with a text by the American poet and visual artist Emmett Williams.\r\n\r\nAbout the Artists\r\n\r\nDieter Roth was born in Hannover, Germany, in 1930, relocated to Switzerland during the war, married, and moved to Iceland in 1957. He died in Basel, Switzerland, in 1998. Björn Roth was born in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1961. He began working closely with his father on painting, music, lms, and publications as well as exhibiting in various galleries and museums.\r\n\r\nDieter Roth’s art has been the subject of numerous international retrospectives including ‘Roth Time. A Dieter Roth Retrospective’, which traveled to Schlaulager, Basel, Switzerland (2003), to Museum Moderne Kunst, Stiftung Ludwig, Cologne, Germany (2003), and Museum of Modern Art, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Centre, New York NY (2004). Recent solo exhibitions include; ‘Dieter Roth and Björn Roth – Islands’, Pirelli HangarBicocca, Milan, Italy (2013); ‘Wait, Later This Will All Be Nothing: Dieter Roth Editions’, MoMA Museum of Modern Art, New York NY (2013); ‘Dieter Roth. Björn Roth’, the inaugural exhibition at Hauser &amp; Wirth New York, 18th Street (2013); ‘And away with the minutes. Dieter Roth and Music’, Kunsthaus Zug, Zug, Switzerland (2014) &amp; Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, Germany (2015); and ‘Roth Bar &amp; Studio. Dieter Roth, Björn Roth, Oddur Roth’, Hauser &amp; Wirth Zürich (2015); ‘Dieter Roth: Schöne Scheiße. Dilettantische Meisterwerke (Dieter Roth: Shit Sublime. The Imperfect Masterpieces)’, Museum Ostwall, Dortmund, Germany (2016).\r\n"

          "LMAKgallery presents Liminal, an exhibition by Rachel Mica Weiss in the gallery’s courtyard. The solo presentation of three new floor-based sculptures carries forward the artist’s process-based inquiry into boundaries, thresholds, and human capacity.\r\n\r\nIn each work, malleable, marble-like slabs pose on glassy, metallic plinths. These “stone” objects, whose surfaces swirl in un-stone-like colors, touch upon the uncanny, exhibiting the possibilities of fabric more than the permanence of inert earth matter. Scaled to the dimensions of Weiss’s own figure, these cast concrete objects are embodiments of the artist: she forms them by compacting and twisting the wet concrete and shoving her body into the material. Each sculpture’s stone—often used by the artist to stand in for the human body—peels up provocatively or slumps over, exhausted from the conditions of its own making.\r\n\r\nThese sumptuous yet simple surfaces are not necessarily to be believed; the artist toys with the materiality and immateriality of the objects themselves, upending our assumptions about their composition and capabilities. The polished surfaces of the pedestals emit a lightness that contravenes our beliefs about the weighty bodies they support—or perhaps conceal; these posed stone forms float over hazy doubles living within the non-space of the mirrored pedestal.\r\n\r\nWeiss’s works exist at an intersection or threshold—activated/inert, rigid/pliable, alive/dead, real/facsimile. Each sculpture affirms the coexistence of such dualities, and each represents the liminal: the ambiguous point of transition from one stage to another, the point at which a restructuring occurs.\r\n\r\nRachel Mica Weiss (b. 1986) holds a B.A. from Oberlin College, an M.F.A. in sculpture from the San Francisco Art Institute, and she is a 2011 recipient of the San Francisco Foundation Murphy and Cadogan Fellowship. Her solo exhibitions include Countermeasures at Montserrat College of Art, MA (2015), In Place at Fridman Gallery, NY (2014) and Engulfing the Elusory at the San Francisco Arts Commission (2013). Group exhibition venues include: Wayne State University, MI; BravinLee Programs, NY; Storefront Ten Eyck, NY; SOMArts Cultural Center, SF; and the Fiber Philadelphia Biennial, PA. Weiss has been commissioned to create permanent, large-scale installations for 1 Hotel and The Ashland in Brooklyn, NY; Handel Architects’ 525W52, NY; the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, through the State Department’s Art in Embassies Program; and the lobby of MediaMath’s 4 World Trade Center office. She has also created large-scale installations for Norwood, NY; Nassau Community College, NY; and PULSE New York, 2015. Her work has been reviewed in the Boston Globe and San Francisco Chronicle, and has appeared in Hyperallergic, Bad at Sports, and several international publications.

          "With the Eyes of Others: Hungarian Artists of the Sixties and Seventies presents more than one hundred works by thirty artists active in the Hungarian Neo-avant-garde in the latter half of the 20th Century. Organized by New York-based guest curator András Szántó, this will be the first large-scale exhibition in the United States devoted to a fertile yet underappreciated period in Hungarian art. Against the backdrop of an authoritarian system, which placed strict ideological limits on free expression, this group of artists found diverse and inventive ways in which to encrypt and express powerful messages in the face of the constrained social, cultural, and political reality of their time.\r\n \r\nThe artists in this exhibition operated inside the confines of the one-party state – a somewhat permissive socialist state, to be sure, when compared to other nations in the Eastern Bloc, but one in which open dissent was not tolerated. Most of the featured artists in With the Eyes of Others have not yet been on view in New York before. What unites them is that, one way or another, they were all playing a game of hide and seek with the state authorities.\r\n \r\nSpread over both floors of the Elizabeth Dee Gallery, the exhibition – the second thematic historical show since the gallery’s relocation to Harlem – With the Eyes of Others offers a comprehensive introduction to the period, capturing the particular mood and texture of the non-official art scene. On the one hand, Hungarian artists were close enough to the West to consider themselves flagbearers of the avant-garde. They eagerly followed and responded to artistic developments in London, Cologne, and New York. On the other hand, these artists did not have regular access to the institutions, publications, and networks of the Western art capitals. Their semi-peripheral, semi-connected state endowed the Hungarian Neo-avant-garde with a particular outlook, language, and attitude.\r\n \r\nLoosely organized around four themes, the exhibition explores diverse strategies of evasion which artists deployed to put forward independent, even controversial positions without getting caught up in the web of censorship. Some painters developed their own highly abstract pictorial style, escaping into a self-enclosed universe of optical perception and remove that was seemingly devoid of politics, even while its allegiance to abstraction signaled coded affinities to the West. Other artists pursued conceptual investigations so obscure as to render their works inaccessible to all but the small, closed coterie of artists and intellectual allies. Still others turned to humor, thumbing their noses in expressions of seemingly pointless behavior—a form of jest that asserted individualism in a language that would not allow itself to be taken too seriously. Still others staged evanescent actions, often in informal venues, documented for posterity but slipping from view before the authorities could arrive on the scene.\r\n \r\nPictorial and conceptual, visual and performative positions overlapped and interconnected on the small, informal scene. Some players emerged out of the world of poetry and literature as much as from the academies of fine art. Most of them were concentrated in Budapest, but key figures resided outside the capital, including the town of Pécs. The artists typically ranged freely across artistic media—there was no market or hardened critical consensus to steer them to one approach. Their practices correspondingly encompass an eclectic array of form, scale, and materials – from magisterial abstractions to diminutive photographs and drawings, to sculpture and video.\r\n \r\nMuch of the recent interest in East Central Europe in the post-war era derives from the closed nature of life under socialism and the corresponding delay in recognizing the rich cultural activity that thrived even under repressive circumstances. The exhibition includes documentary images from the ArtPool archive in Budapest that bring to life the atmosphere of the scene. The works and documents vividly call to life a period when artists operating at a distance from the Western mainstream nonetheless produced a legacy of works that appear extraordinarily fresh and relevant today.\r\n \r\nMost of the key figures of the period appear in the exhibition, including some who, late in life, are being embraced by international museums, biennials, and collectors. Even so, most of the artists in With the Eyes of Others have not exhibited in New York or the U.S. Their groundbreaking and courageous work during the Cold War remains largely unknown outside Hungary.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition includes a small display of works produced in recent years by some of the participating artists who are still actively working. It will coincide with a colloquium with Columbia University dedicated to the Hungarian culture of the sixties and seventies. In addition to a lead essay by András Szántó, a richly illustrated catalogue will feature texts by Hungarian expert contributors, Emese Kürti, Dávid Fehér, and interviews by Nóra Winkler with eyewitnesses from the period, including some of the featured artists.\r\n \r\nAndrás Szántó, Ph.D. is a New York-based author and a cultural-strategy consultant to leading museums, foundations, and companies worldwide. His writings have appeared in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, Artforum, Museum Practice, and many other publications.  The former director of the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, Szántó has been a visiting critic at the American Academy in Rome, a visiting senior fellow at the Center for Arts and Culture in Washington, DC, and a research affiliate of the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies at Princeton University. Since 2014, he has overseen the Global Museum Leaders Colloquium at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r\n \r\n \r\nGábor Attalai\r\nImre Bak\r\nLászló Beke\r\nMiklós Erdély\r\nFerenc Ficzek\r\nTibor Gáyor\r\nGyula Gulyás\r\nTibor Hajas\r\nKároly Halász\r\nIstván Haraszty\r\nTamás Hencze\r\nGyörgy Jovánovics\r\nIlona Keserű\r\nKároly Kismányoky\r\nKatalin Ladik\r\nLaszló Lakner\r\nDóra Maurer\r\nJános Megyik\r\nLászló Méhes\r\nIstván Nádler\r\nGyula Pauer\r\nPécs Workshop\r\nGéza Perneczky\r\nSándor Pinczehelyi\r\nTamás Szentjóby\r\nKálmán Szijártó\r\nBálint Szombathy\r\nEndre Tót\r\nJános Vető\r\n\r\nThis exhibition has been made possible thanks to the generous collaboration of Gábor Pados and Orsolya Hegedűs at ACB Gallery, Margit Valkó at Kisterem Gallery, Attila Pőcze at Vintage Gallery, Katherine Kostyal at White Cube, London, and the Museum of Fine Arts and Artpool Art Research Center, Budapest.

          "What interests me is the transformation, not the monument. I don’t construct ruins, but I feel ruins are moments when things show themselves. A ruin is not a catastrophe. It is the moment when things can start again.\r\n—Anselm Kiefer\r\n\r\nGagosian presents new paintings, artists’ books, and watercolors by Anselm Kiefer. \r\n\r\nEmploying broad-ranging and erudite literary sources, from the Old and New Testaments to the poetry of Paul Celan, Kiefer’s oeuvre makes palpable the movement and destruction of human life and, at the same time, the persistence of the delicate, lyrical, or divine.\r\n\r\nCentral to the exhibition are more than forty unique artists’s books, their pages painted with gesso to mimic marble, displayed in an installation of glass vitrines. Erotically charged female nudes and faces emerge from the pages. Artists’s books are an integral part of Kiefer’s oeuvre; over time they have ranged in scale from the intimate to the monumental, and in materials, from lead to dried plant matter. In this selection of books, the sequences of narrative information and visual effect evoke the fragile endurance of the sacred and the spiritual through the female figures on the marbled pages. They are a reminder perhaps of the sculptures of Auguste Rodin, and even of Michelangelo’s belief that his figures were “freed” from the stone with which he worked.\r\n\r\nThe large array of new watercolors in this exhibition marks a significant return in Kiefer’s work to the elusive and sensuous medium. The exhibition’s title, “Transition from Cool to Warm,” refers to a celebrated book of watercolors that he produced from 1974 to 1977, in which cool, blue marine land and seascapes transform into warm female nudes. Kiefer’s fascination for eidetic process, rather than teleological outcome is underscored by the alchemical effects he achieves in these new works—aleatory, and as luminescent as the natural forms they evoke.\r\n\r\nThe watercolors and books are complemented by romantic landscape paintings, in which lakes can be glimpsed through screens of trees or where surfaces of splashed molten lead peel back to reveal the sea or landscape depicted beneath.\r\n\r\n“Transition from Cool to Warm” is accompanied by a fully illustrated publication with essays by Karl Ove Knausgaard and James Lawrence, and an interview with Kiefer by Louisa Buck.\r\n\r\nAnselm Kiefer was born in 1945 in Donaueschingen, Germany, and lives and works in France. His work is collected by museums worldwide. Recent institutional exhibitions include Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk, Denmark (2010); “Shevirat Hakelim,” Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel (2011); “Beyond Landscape,” Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo (2013); Royal Academy of Arts, London (2014); “L’Alchimie du livre,” Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris (2015); Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (2015). In 2009, he directed and designed the sets for Am Anfang (In the Beginning) at the Opéra national de Paris. “Kiefer Rodin” will be on view at the Musée Rodin, Paris until October 2017, subsequently traveling to the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia. In November 2017, Kiefer will receive the J. Paul Getty medal for his contribution to the arts."

          "TOTAH presents Transient, an exhibition of California Light and Space artists Helen Pashgian and Brian Wills.\r\n\r\nBoth Pashgian, pioneer of the original Light and Space movement, and Wills, of its next generation, traffic in obsessive experimentation with the conditions of vision. Seeking patterns of line and color, depth and motion, transparency and opacity, reflection and refraction, their true medium is light itself. Transient slices across physics and neuroscience, optics and vision; requiring of the viewer to navigate the tension between the eye, the brain and the body. Space is arguably incalculable without Light - oscillating between wave and particle - but most certainly indiscernible without movement, with which we travel around and through a work of art and take possession of it as our own.\r\n\r\nPashgian and Wills share a trademark of testing the boundaries of their craft, laboring over their materials until they disembody, abandoning their very mundane physicality. With skills approaching scientific exactitude, Wills stretches thousands of infinitely hued nylon and rayon threads against wood frames, while Pashgian relentlessly drives epoxy into molds that defy all previous applications. Both artists’ subject is the proto-light of the west, that blue, harsh light … reflecting and refracting off surfaces, smog, mist, casting shadows, and at times flashing brilliant diamond white, bright as an atom bomb. Light is as old as the universe itself, and yet, as new and exciting as ever. Pashgian and Wills explore alongside the likes of Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, and (literally for Pashgian) Richard Feynman, using abstraction, instead of mathematics or music, to confront new possibilities of understanding color, movement and spatial relationships - whether immediate or cosmological.\r\n\r\nUniting Pashgian and Wills’ works is the singularity, that point of no return where only artists and scientists go, with endless curiosity and passion, in the name of discovery. So Wills spans myriad multicolored strings against shallow depths, aggregating integers of transparency - the surfaces of his work so infinitesimally varied in resolution as one moves across them - as to approach eternity. While Pashgian casts shadows of nebulous origin deep within her unfathomable plasmic substances – so that one dances around guessing at the source of their emanating light, and of their changing colors, hues and forms.\r\n\r\nThis then occurs, the hallmark of great art: suddenly we are close looking; we’ve surrendered seeing; the object disappears and we are left with just ourselves; vibrating, pulsating, engaged, entranced in deep play with that mother of all creation: wonder.\r\n"

          "Mary Boone Gallery presents Kindly Bent to Ease Us by LEIDY CHURCHMAN. The exhibition of new work is shown in collaboration with Janice Guy and is curated by Piper Marshall.\r\n\r\nIn a 1977 issue of the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Robert Thurman critiqued Kindly Bent to Ease Us, a translation of the renowned Nyingma master Longchenpa undertaken by German Buddhist scholar Herbert Guenther. Articulated as a review of the adaptation, Thurman argued that the translation eclipsed the meaning of the original text. “Unfortunately,” he began, “Guenther ruins the whole thing, shrouding the jewel of the original with his own intellectual obscurities so that we catch only an occasional glint of its brilliance.” Thurman then offered his own title, \r\nRelief of Weariness by Ultimate Mind, asserting that it was more faithful to the original ideas.\r\n\r\nReflecting on the contrast between these two titles claiming the same source, the exhibition considers the relationship between conceptual intelligibility and a Buddhist emphasis on direct perception - what is lost and what is found in the process of translation. In the paintings on view, Churchman selectively reiterates subject matter from fellow artists as well as images from printed matter and the web. Existing images are altered, replicated, and reframed. The artist also includes printed reproductions of artworks and a co-made painting to extend the notion of interdependent systems. In an effort to reconcile the metaphysical typically tethered to painting and the current discourse around appropriation, Churchman slows down the process of perception and calls attention to the cycling of imagery through different sites and registers. His new body of work dials up uncertainty around how we receive information, asking us not to simply trust suggestions, facts, and media but to retain ambivalence and curiosity. Rather than an articulated effort to provide answers, or an escape into distraction, the iterations in Kindly Bent to Ease Us serve as a catalyst, involving the viewer in a process of activation and skepticism.\r\n\r\nLeidy Churchman’s work has been exhibited at venues such as Kölnischer \r\nKunstverein, Cologne; Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Kunsthalle Bern, Bern; Highline, New York; Yale Union, Portland; Museum Brandhorst, Munich; The National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen; Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, Houston; Human Resources, Los Angeles; Stroom Den Haag, The Hague; Museum of Art at \r\nRhode Island School of Design, Providence; and MoMA PS1, New York."

          "Matthew Marks presents Ray Johnson, the next exhibition in his gallery at 523 West 24th Street. Included are over thirty collages spanning nearly three decades. \r\n\r\nJohnson is one of the more eccentric figures in contemporary art. Born in Detroit in 1929, he attended the legendary Black Mountain College, where he met and befriended many of the leading avant-garde figures of the day. He moved to New York in 1949 and began exhibiting abstract paintings. Within a few years, however, he had rejected painting in favor of collage. That medium’s combinatory principles became central to his art, which grew to encompass performance, conceptual art, and sculpture. By the late 1950s his practice of mailing collages to friends and acquaintances had become a primary artistic focus, directly giving rise to the Mail Art movement. \r\n\r\nJohnson’s collage works, which often incorporate celebrity images cut from magazines, are considered among the earliest examples of Pop art. He exhibited them at galleries and museums in the 1960s and 1970s, but starting in the late 1970s, with only a few exceptions, he stopped showing his work publicly. He never stopped working, however, and by 1995, when he committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, he had created an extraordinarily rich and varied body of work.\r\n\r\nIt was during Johnson’s reclusive final decades that he created most of the works in this exhibition, building them up in layers of magazine clippings, found photographs, and handmade marks. He worked in a nonlinear way, often setting aside a collage for years before picking it up, adding to it, and setting it aside again. This layering can be seen in the works’ content too, with images and phrases (such as “mouth of the month,” “Janis Joplin’s mother’s hat,” and “I love you Alice B. Toklas”) joined together in associative chains that are equal parts comedy and poetry. \r\n\r\nAs Johnson grew increasingly isolated, he seemed to build a world within his work, filling it with a peculiar mix of celebrities, writers, and members of the New York art world. A partial list from this exhibition alone: David Bowie, William Burroughs, John Cage, Salvador Dalí, Candy Darling, James Dean, Jacques Derrida, Agnes Gund, Arsenio Hall, Peter Hujar, Jasper Johns, Sophia Loren, Agnes Martin, Louise Nevelson, River Phoenix, Paloma Picasso, Lou Reed, Gertrude Stein, and Shirley Temple.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated 192-page catalogue with an essay by Brad Gooch.\r\n\r\nJohnson’s work has been shown in museums across the United States and Europe, including one-person exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Oslo. In 1999 the Whitney Museum of American Art organized “Ray Johnson: Correspondences,” the first full-scale retrospective of his work.\r\n"

          "Curated by Gabriela Rangel and Lucía Sanromán\r\n\r\nThe exhibition Erick Meyenberg: The wheel bears no resemblance to a leg is the end result of the artist’s collaboration with members of the high school marching band, Banda de Guerra Lobos, at the Colegio Hispanoamericano in Mexico City. Meyenberg and the teenagers—together with curators, guest musicians, composers, costume designers, and a video production team—co-created choreographies, musical scores, and a series of performances that took the band through some of the city’s most emblematic and politically marked sites: the Plaza de Tlatelolco, where striking university students clashed with the state in 1968; the Monumento a la Revolución, commemorating the Mexican Revolution of 1910; and the Forum Buenavista shopping center, symbolizing Mexico’s embeddedness in transnational capitalism.\r\n\r\nMeyenberg developed The wheel bears no resemblance to a leg (2016) over two years as a commission for inSite/Casa Gallina, the sixth edition of the public art project, inSite. The exhibition is co-organized by Americas Society and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, and is curated by Americas Society’s Visual Arts Director and Chief Curator Gabriela Rangel and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts’ Visual Arts Director Lucía Sanromán. A press preview and reception will be held at the Americas Society Art Gallery in New York City on Wednesday, May 3, 5:00 p.m., followed by a panel discussion with the artist and the curators. RSVP: mediarelations@as-coa.org\r\n\r\nComposed of a three-channel projection, flags, a relief sculpture, and archival materials, The wheel bears no resemblance to a leg takes its enigmatic title from the 1917 prologue to Guillaume Apollinaire’s 1903 play Les mamelles de Tirésias (The Breasts of Tiresias). Meyenberg’s project translates these sources into a critical stance toward normative pedagogical structures—here taking the form of uniforms, discipline, education, gender, the state, and symbols of nationhood—and a conception of the “surreal” not as an evasion of reality, but as an invitation to surmount other realities. Culminating in a synesthetic experience, The wheel bears no resemblance to a leg suggests the complexities of Mexican modernity.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a forthcoming richly illustrated publication, which documents the process and performance of The wheel bears no resemblance to a leg and includes essays by Gabriela Rangel and Osvaldo Sánchez, as well as an interview with the artist by Lucía Sanromán.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE ARTIST\r\nErick Meyenberg (b. 1980, Mexico City) works at the intersection of drawing, collage, video, data analysis, and sound. The artist studied visual arts at the National School of Fine Arts (ENAP) in Mexico City. In 2009, he was a guest student at the Berlin University of Arts (UdK), under the guidance of the German artist Rebecca Horn. His work received the honorable mention Centennial Award at ZONA MACO in 2011. Solo exhibitions have included Un Futuro Anterior (An Anterior Future), Laboratorio Arte Alameda, Mexico City and Aspirantes (Aspirants) for Proyecto Líquido, Mexico City (2016); The Return of the Dinosaur, Museo Universitario del Chopo, Mexico City (2014), Back to the Present, Arróniz Arte Contemporáneo, Mexico City (2011), Das ist kein Fleisch, International Festival of Lights (FILUX), Laboratorio de Arte Alameda, Mexico City (2013), and Labor Berlin 2: Erick Meyenberg. Étude taxonomique-comparative entre les castes de la Nouvelle Espagne et celles du Mexique contemporain, Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin (2010).\r\n\r\nThe presentation at Americas Society of Erick Meyenberg: The wheel bears no resemblance to a leg is made possible by the generous support of the Panta Rhea Foundation and Genomma Lab Internacional. This program is also supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council. Additional support comes from AMEXCID, the Consulate General of Mexico, the Mexican Cultural Institute of New York, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.\r\n\r\nThe video piece The wheel bears no resemblance to a leg was commissioned by inSite/Casa Gallina, 2014–16, and curated by Osvaldo Sánchez and Josefa Ortega. The production in Mexico City was made possible through the generous support of Cámara de Diputados (México), Secretaría de Cultura (México), and Fundación Jumex Arte Contemporáneo."

          "Mary Boone Gallery presents at its Chelsea location imagination, dead imagine, an installation with sound and video projection by JUDITH BARRY. The exhibition is curated by Piper Marshall.\r\n\r\nAn androgynous head is projected onto five sides of a larger-than-life cube, accompanied only by the sound of the slow inhale and exhale of the figure. Without warning, a substance spills onto the face: the impact registers on five sides of the die. We may be repelled: we wish to turn away: however, we are transfixed in fascination. The spectacle overwhelms our urges, subduing them to the point of tolerance. Willfully, we submit our vision to the disturbing projection, until suddenly the head emerges again. Wiped clean it is redeemed, only to be subjected to an abuse outside \r\nits control yet again.\r\n\r\nThe evocative action in this sequence echoes the spill of painting, the ground against which minimal art transgresses. Barry’s figurative gesture pushes against this more totalizing discourse and re-inscribes the body within its geometry. The fluid serves as a vital force, one which drowns the body and calls attention to that permeable border between life and death as the latter infects the former. While we zero in on the drama of the cube, we become more acutely aware of its blind-spots: the off-screen space which commands the action on the screen, pointing to the mystification inherent in the vision machine. Indeed, most compelling in this film is the uncontrollable action that produces a trauma and in so doing offers its processing. Similar to the current state of affairs, the repeated abuse simultaneously numbs and stuns. In Barry’s work, horror at the action trumps the sublime, grounding it in a material and tangible confrontation to be experienced over and over again in a space of possibilities.\r\n\r\nJudith Barry’s research-based practice utilizes installation, architecture and design, film/video, performance, sculpture, photography, and new media. Barry has exhibited internationally at such venues as Documenta, Berlin Biennale, Venice Biennale of Art/Architecture, Sao Paulo Biennale, the Carnegie International, adn the Whitney Biennial. In 2000, Barry was awarded the Kiesler Prize for Architecture and the Arts. Select public collections include Art Gallery of Ontario, Toroonto, Canada; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; DIA Center for the Arts, New York; MACBA - Museum of Contemporary Art, and “La Caixa”, Barcelona, Spain; Museum of Modern Art, New York; and MUMOK, Vienna, Austria."

          "Gallery Vallois America presents an exhibition “Time on Earth” by Franco-Beninese ceramist King Houndekpinkou.  \r\n\r\nIn 2017, Gallery Vallois France places the entirety of its exhibition programming under the sign of Benin. Through artistic and cultural exchanges it has initiated since 2012 in Cotonou (capital of Benin), Gallery Vallois is Patron of the Arts and Culture Center in Lobozounkpa, a multidisciplinary space dedicated to contemporary creation in all its forms, directed by Dominique Zinkpè.\r\n\r\nOn the same site, since 2015, the Petit Musée de la Récade is home to a permanent collection of “recades” or royal scepters and the site for diverse contemporary art exhibitions. In this context, our New York space will present the work of King Houndekpinkou in New York with an exhibition comprising twenty works in ceramic.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1987 in the outskirts of Paris, King created a refined and spiritual body of work inspired by both Japan and his African roots.  He studied at length the traditions of the non-enameled ceramics of Bizen (a region of Okayama), where King continues to visit every year.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, King’s creative process implements an intimate and direct relationship with the material that he scratches, tears and repairs, thus creating simultaneously graceful and raw artworks. It is on the occasion of a first trip to Japan in 2012, that he discovers ceramics. He then became aware of the universality of clay, which encouraged him to return to his roots and his ancestors of Benin through works made from the most elemental of materials from the earth. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition ‘Time on Earth’ sacralizes precisely the earth, which constitutes a source of memory rich with knowledge and the vestiges left by man. Besides, the first ceramists were shamans who were able to read the oracles in the clay.\r\n"

          "SANDRA GERING INC presents JENNIFER WEN MA: Eight Views of Paradise Interrupted. \r\n\r\nJennifer Wen Ma creates delicate, ephemeral installations out of paper, ink, glass and light, fusing aspects of Chinese and European art history with a distinctly contemporary approach. For this exhibition, the artist presents an environment of new works borrowing from the Chinese literati landscape painting trope of Eight Views of Xiaoxiang. This homage meditates on the mental landscape that yielded the artist’s concept for the acclaimed installation opera Paradise Interrupted, exploring the utopian idea of ‘paradise’. Originally presented at the Lincoln Center Festival last summer, the opera was the artist’s directorial debut. It combined Ma’s innovative set designs with her co-written libretto and a contemporary composition in the traditional kunqu vocal singing style with western operatic voice. \r\n\r\nEight Views features some of Ma’s best-known iconography: her unconventional use of ink and her multifaceted use of the garden as metaphor. Her incorporation of time as material is also significant, whether expressed through performance, narrative, or the movement of light, air and liquid. Upon entering the low-lit exhibition, the viewer is enveloped by the show’s two signature works. A 43-foot long, scroll-like landscape painting on translucent acrylic is layered with shadows created from light projections across its surface. Composed of many individual panels that cover three walls, the paintings’ shimmering looking-glass surface is designed to flow together, offering a panoramic view and placing the viewer’s reflection within the landscape. The nuanced painting, as subtle and mystical as the traditional works it references, speaks of the artist’s contribution to both Eastern and Western artistic discourse. In the center of the room, a striking, large-scale black paper floor sculpture of a garden stands, tight and controlled in places and wild and unruly in others. Its accordion-like structure allows its form to adapt to a variety of settings. Based on her opera set design, the garden also references the live plants worldwide that the artist has painted with Chinese ink, hereby transforming them into three-dimensional Chinese landscape scrolls that change over time. \r\n\r\nEight Views of Paradise Interrupted brings these elements together in a formally beautiful, conceptually complex and historically rich installation. \r\n\r\nEarlier pieces also on view include Brain Storm, 2009, the first of several videos using ink on glass as a medium, and the mirror-surfaced Dodo with 100 Meeps Walking in the Desert in Five Movements, 2011.\r\n\r\nMa is also known for her extensive multimedia endeavors, from the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony to the permanent interactive artwork on the “Water Cube” in Beijing that reflects the resident’s daily emotions through abstract light, color and movement. \r\n\r\nConcurrently, the artist will be exhibiting a related project, Night Which Contains the Sea at Van Doren Waxter, 23 East 73rd Street, NY.\r\n\r\nJennifer Wen Ma has exhibited widely since 1993. In addition to Lincoln Center, solo projects, installations and exhibitions include the Cass Sculpture Foundation, Sussex, England, The Guggenheim Museum, NY, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, the Qatar Museums, Doha, Qatar, the National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts, Taiwan, Performa 13, NY, the National Art Museum of China, Beijing, the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C., the Market Square Public Art Program, Pittsburgh, PA, the Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, BC and the Echigo-Tsumari Triennial, Niigata, Japan, the Singapore Biennial and the Sydney Biennale, among others. Ma’s work on the opening &amp; closing ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics earned the artist an Emmy in 2008. Jennifer Wen Ma lives in New York &amp; Beijing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

          "Jennifer Wen Ma creates a new site-specific installation, Night Which Contains the Sea, for the foyer at Van Doren Waxter, begining May 11, 2017.\r\n\r\nThis installation in two parts posits a world of duality represented in Yin and Yang, fullness and emptiness, light and dark, positive and negative space, motion and stillness. It is a freeze frame of energies in flux and establishing balance, reflected in these forms still in the process of becoming.\r\n\r\nOn one side, a form comprised of a voluminous and chaotic mass of cut black paper is suspended from the top of the recess. Cascading down from the mass are dark colored glass pieces in shapes reminiscent of teardrops, embryos, cancer cells, and other organic forms. Lowest hanging and farthest from the paper form are sperm-shaped glass.\r\n\r\nIn the mirroring niche, a single large clear glass sculpture hangs. The bulbous form is reminiscent of the breasts and buttocks of a voluptuous woman, inspired by the Venus of Willendorf. Rising up from the bottom of the niche to meet and cradle the glass form is a nest of cut paper, formed from the cut-away parts of the paper from the first niche.\r\n\r\nThe artist will have a coinciding solo exhibition, Eight Views of Paradise Interrupted, on view at Sandra Gering Inc. from May 11 - July 27, 2017.\r\n"

          "Paul Kasmin Gallery presents Mark Ryden: The Art of Whipped Cream. The exhibition will feature drawings, sketches and paintings created for the production of American Ballet Theatre’s Whipped Cream. A concurrent exhibition of Ryden’s work for the ballet will be held at Gallery Met located at the Metropolitan Opera House, May 19 – July 8, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition will coincide with American Ballet Theatre’s New York premiere of Whipped Cream at the Metropolitan Opera House (May 22, 2017), featuring choreography by Alexei Ratmansky with the original 20th-Century score by Richard Strauss. Ryden conceived backdrops, props and costumes for the ballet, all of which retain the artist’s meticulous attention to detail and intricate craftsmanship seen throughout his oeuvre.\r\n\r\nOriginally titled Schlagobers, the Austrian word for whipped cream, the production adapts a rediscovered Richard Strauss ballet from 1924 that centers on a boy who, after overindulging on treats at a pastry shop, falls into a state of delirium in which his candy confections come to life. Drawing from this narrative, Ryden further delves into the darker undercurrents of sweetness, from its sugary excesses to the intoxicating effects of overindulgence.\r\n\r\nCharacter studies in oil on panel, as well as graphite on paper, introduce a peculiar new collection of characters to Ryden’s fantastical world. Princess Tea Flower (2016), the personification of pink and green flowering tea leaves, carries herself in a classical ballerina pose. Champagne and vodka costumes drawn for the figures of Marianne (2016) and Boris (2016) incorporate elements of kitsch, complete with their identifying liquor labels. Desserts Counter (2016) presents an enticing cluster of Viennese confections in candy-colored tones: cupcakes, coffee and cocoa tins, and towers of pastries floating in front of a pink background. In addition to these new characters, many of the artist’s most enduring motifs and familiar creatures reappear in this body of work.\r\n\r\nRyden’s beloved Snow Yak reemerges from its 2008 namesake The Snow Yak Show in Whipped Cream as an eye-catching character donning the beautiful Princess Praline in her procession scene. Throughout the various sets and backdrops designed for the ballet, Snow Yak materializes as symbols incarnated, as well as in a schematic sketch of the two-person costume design. Introducing characters from previous bodies of work, Ryden blurs the boundary between ballet’s status as a product of high culture and its place in the wider contemporary cultural imagination.\r\n\r\nIn its review of the ballet, The New York Times praised Ryden’s work:\r\n\r\nThe subject matter is kitsch, not because it’s fantasy but in the word’s original sense of mass-produced popular art, culture marketed for shopping. And yet this production is a triumph of stylishness. Sets (several in each act) and costumes by Mark Ryden are fantastic in color, line and detail. Ultrasweet kiddie-type cuteness is constantly invoked — there are giant toys, a carriage horse played by two dancers, and cupcake children — but so much careful affection is evident that kitsch is both triumphant and transcended.\r\n\r\nMark Ryden (b. 1963, Medford, Oregon) is known for his hauntingly beautiful and masterfully executed oil paintings that encompass contemporary mythologies with fairy-tale creatures, historical figures and pop cultural icons. Ryden received his BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 1987.\r\n\r\nThis past year, Ryden’s work was the subject of his first major European retrospective held at the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga in Spain. It is the museum’s most widely attended exhibition to date. Previous solo exhibitions include a mid-career retrospective Wondertoonel at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, which traveled to the Pasadena Museum of California Art (2004-2005); Dodecahedron, at Paul Kasmin Gallery (December 2015); and The Gay 90’s: Old Tyme Art Show at Paul Kasmin Gallery (Spring 2010). Recent museum exhibitions also include Juxtapoz x Superflat at Pivot Art + Culture in Seattle, which traveled to Vancouver Art Gallery (2016); Takashi Murakami’s Superflat Collection at the Yokohama Museum of Art, Japan (2016); and The Artist’s Museum: Los Angeles Artists 1980-2010, at the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (2010). \r\n\r\nMark Ryden has been represented by Paul Kasmin Gallery since 2009. The Art of Whipped Cream marks the artist’s third exhibition at the gallery. He currently lives and works in Portland, Oregon."

          "D O R S K Y   G A L L E R Y | Curatorial Programs presents the continuation of its program of independently-curated exhibitions–  \r\nAlmost Home: Between Staying And Leaving A Phantom Land curated by Shlomit Dror.  A color brochure with an essay by the curator has been published to accompany the exhibition.\r\n\r\nAlmost Home explores complex and timely issues relating to physical displacement and migration –    detachment vs. embrace, estrangement vs. connection, alienation vs. belonging, insider vs. outsider, transience vs. permanence, and foreigner vs. native.\r\n\r\nDror discusses in her essay how the roles of geography, family and personal history, memory, cultural identification, and personal identity influence the experience engendered by displacement or migration.  She writes, “In situations of journeying from place to place, whether temporarily, or with the intent of permanent resettlement, a strong impulse to retain one’s otherness competes with an even stronger one to blend in.” The artists of Almost Home examine the experience of living between places and cultures, raising questions about locality and its roles. They often address these issues by materializing places from memory. Whether their works were inspired by their personal immigration experience, or those close to them, these artists’ exploration of attachment and detachment and of insider and outsider, underlines the idea of connecting with more than one place at a time.\r\n\r\nShlomit Dror is a curator working in Greater New York. She has organized several group exhibitions  and held positions as Consulting Curator of American Art at the Newark Museum, Curatorial Assistant at the 2011 Inchoen Women Artists Biennale, and at El Museo del Barrio, Félix González-Torres Foundation and the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. She has written for catalogues for the Newark Museum, CUE Art Foundation, Point of Contact Gallery, and published multiple online essays. She was a guest juror at Fresh Paint Art Fair in Tel Aviv, Visual Arts Center of New Jersey, City Without Walls among others, and has served as a visiting critic at Residency Unlimited, NARS Foundation, The Wassaic Project, Wave Hill Visual Arts Program and the Elizabeth Foundation. Dror earned an MA in Museum Studies from New York University and a BA in Art History and Latin American Studies from Bard College, and participated in Independent Curators International’s (ICI) Curatorial Intensive Program.\r\n\r\nFeaturing works by: Wafaa Bilal, Keren Benbenisty, Juanli Carrión, Daniel Greenfield-Campoverde, Claudia Joskowicz, Ayesha Kamal Khan, Dana Levy, Esperanza Mayobre, Elham Rokni, and \r\nKarina Aguilera Skvirsky"

          "Gallery Korea of the Korean Cultural Center New York, a branch of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea, present In/visible: Things to be Discussed. \r\n\r\nThis group exhibition is curated by ‘haewooso,’ a group of three emerging curators based in Seoul and New York: Edie Yonwoo Kim, Hae Lin Park, and So-Ok Park. The exhibition brings together six emerging artists; Byeong Gi Baek, Caiti Borruso, Daniel Goldfarb, Hyejin Jo, Alex Strada, and Seok-Il You.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary world we live in today overflows with information and images. People have grown accustomed to making judgments only from what they see on the surface. In/visible encourages the audience to perceive things that have been unconfronted, things that people may have missed out in their lives.\r\n\r\nByeong Gi Baek’s installation reflects a recent tragedy in Korea through the image of a whale; Caiti Borruso uses photographs to mirror the psychological distance in her relationship with her hometown as well as her personal trauma; Daniel Goldfarb’s video evokes the concept of excluded beings in society through a character named BLOCH; Hyejin Jo’s installation takes issue with the ironic nature of tropical plants that are now prevalent in Korean society where the climate is not ideal for such plant life; Alex Strada’s photographs of miniatures of world-famous landmarks reveals hidden power relationships in the history of the world; Seok-Il You examines the unique nature of youth communities by observing the behaviors of young Koreans during a period of policy change.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition provides an opportunity for fresh perspectives, opening our eyes to the overlooked and observing the “invisibles” from the “visibles,” thus to set the stage for what needs to be discussed.\r\n"

          "Lehmann Maupin presents From a whisper to a scream, a group exhibition featuring work by Teresita Fernández, Jeffrey Gibson, and Shirazeh Houshiary. The artists in this exhibition all draw from the visual vocabulary of Minimalism in their use of industrial materials, deliberate restriction of form, and engagement of physical space, but do so in order to communicate social, political, and cultural meaning in a way that the 1960s movement always resisted. Through painting and sculpture, each artist transforms this typically self-referential genre into one that speaks as loudly as narrative imagery. \r\n\r\nTeresita Fernández (b. 1968, Miami, FL; lives and works in Brooklyn, NY) creates vast abstracted landscapes of minimal color and form that attempt to capture how we experience our surroundings, and how we define our environments in relation to identity and citizenship. For this exhibition, Fernandez will present 3:37 p.m. (2001), a wall installation composed of hundreds of acrylic cubes in seven colors of the light spectrum, a reductive representation of a rainbow captured at a specific moment in time, 3:37 p.m. Fernández’s work is characterized by an interest in perception and the psychology of looking, so she encourages the viewer to conjure up his or her own personal associations with the landscape, which in turn become part of the meaning behind the work.\r\n \r\nJeffrey Gibson (b. 1972, Colorado Springs, CO; lives and works in New York) assimilates influences such as indigenous art and craft, politics, music, fashion, urban subculture, and art historical references to create paintings, sculptures, and beaded tapestries infused with layers of historical, social, and formal content. The six works included in this exhibition are comprised of elements of geometric abstraction and Minimalism, phrases appropriated from popular song lyrics and social movements, and materials such as beads, metal jingles, sinew, and animal rawhide. Gibson, who is of Choctaw and Cherokee heritage and grew up in major urban centers around the world, draws on these influences in his work to subvert and complicate assumptions about both Native American art and identity.\r\n \r\nShirazeh Houshiary (b. 1955, Iran; lives and works in London) makes paintings, sculpture, and animation that seek to challenge viewers’ perceptions of time, space, and materiality. This exhibition will feature two works by Houshiary: Sheer (2012), a sculpture made from aluminum bricks, and Meander (2016), a pencil and pigment work on canvas. Both works are structured around the “rules” of Minimalism—the reduced color palette, the use of industrial material, the restriction of form, and the engagement with physical space—but they prioritize the viewer’s individualized, sensorial, and intellectual experience. Although constructed according to a predetermined set of conditions, Sheer takes on an organic shape as it twists and grows, creating a sense of movement and fluidity that is antithetical to the material. In Meander, Houshiary uses language as the foundation of her gestures, layering contradictory Arabic phrases such as “I am” and “I am not,” until they become illegible. Provoking a variety of nonverbal and visceral associations, Houshiary’s paintings invite viewers to consider the significance and meaning of each individual gesture."

          "Alexander Gray Associates presents its first exhibition of work by Betty Parsons (b.1900, New York City, NY – d.1982, Southold, NY), since recently becoming the representative of the Estate. The exhibition features work from the early 1920s through 1981, tracing her artistic development from realist sculpture to her experimentation with figuration and abstraction in her painting and sculptural practices. The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue featuring a newly written essay by curator Abigail Winograd, and a chronology of Parson’s life by Farrar Fitzgerald, archivist for the Betty Parsons Foundation.\r\n \r\nParsons moved to Paris for 10 years beginning in 1923, during which time she studied painting and sculpture at Antoine Bourdelle’s Academie de la Grande Chaumière, alongside Alberto Giacometti. She went on to study sculpture with Ossip Zadkine and watercolor with Arthur Lindsey. Upon her return to the United States, she studied with Alexander Archipenko in Los Angeles before moving to New York in 1935. Throughout her life, she remained an avid traveler, spending time in Africa, Europe, Mexico, Japan, and elsewhere. She meticulously recorded her travels in her journals as diary entries, watercolors and sketches, a selection of which will be on display. She often drew on a sense of place in her work, as in the lush landscapes Aux en Provence (1927) and Celeste Beach, Acapulco Mexico (1940) in which Parsons experimented with non-naturalistic pigment, often incorporating rich purple and teal in undulating strokes. As critic Roberta Smith describes, Parsons “infused her art with a palpable ease and an instinct for color that was further cultivated by years of travel.” Her adeptness as a colorist is also apparent in Parsons’ larger abstract paintings, the scale of which the artist determined was “out of a desire to get a feeling of an expanding world.”\r\n \r\nIn 1947, Parsons began to paint abstractly; she described this shift as an effort to capture not what a place or event “looked like, but what it made [her] feel.” In the subsequent decades, she referenced sites that resonated with her, without making literal illusions or illustrations. Instead, she aimed to evoke what she characterized as the “sheer energy” of a situation. In some cases, she returned to locations, such as the coast of Maine, frequently and created new paintings each visit based on the shifting atmospheric conditions. Maine (1972) is a deep red vertical composition, with swirling amoebic planes of gold, bordered by rings of the same pastel blue that is applied in patches over the red background. Curator Lawrence Alloway described these renderings as “breathlessly lyrical.” Her thinly painted canvases push the paradigm of flatness in Abstract Expressionism even further than her contemporaries. In many cases she excised lines of paint with the back of her paintbrush, further activating the surface of her compositions. Parsons remained committed to spontaneity and experimentation throughout her life, both as an artist and gallerist. With the Betty Parsons Gallery, which she maintained from 1946 until 1981, she expanded perceptions of art, represented women and artists of color, and was a key force behind the shift that supplanted New York as the center of the art world from Paris. Clement Greenberg lauded her revolutionary contributions, saying “Mrs. Parsons is an artist’s—and a critic’s—gallery: a place where art goes on and is not just shown and sold.”\r\n \r\nParsons explained that her motivation in the studio was a desire to capture “the invisible presence,” a phrase she coined in 1977, which was indicative of her interest in mysticism related to indigenous American art. Her aim to represent pure energy was present in her paintings, assemblages, and diaries. Beginning in 1965, she created painted wooden sculptures, such as African Village (1981), composed of wood elements found during walks on the beach near her studio in Southold, Long Island. As curator Abigail Winograd notes, these geometric assemblages which furthered Parsons’ formal explorations, “are, in some ways, reminiscent of Dada sculpture but also indebted to a lifelong interest in Native American and forms of non-Western artistic practice.”\r\n \r\nParsons serves as a key example of a woman who shaped the canon. Her nearly six decades of luminous paintings were exhibited and sold throughout her lifetime, but were timidly recognized by the art world. Her influence and career as a gallerist has been lauded, yet her oeuvre is deserving of in depth study that reflects her contributions to a key moment in the history of American Art with modes of expression that differed in form and spirit from that of the artists she championed.\r\n \r\nBetty Parsons’ work has been the subject of numerous one-person exhibitions at The Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, East Hampton, NY (1992); the Montclair Museum of Art, Montclair, NJ (1974); Whitechapel Gallery, London, UK (1968), and The Miami Museum of Modern Art, Miami, FL (1963). Parsons’ work is represented in prominent public collections including The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; The Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC; The Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA; The National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC; The Parrish Art Museum, Water Mill, NY; the Montclair Museum of Art, Montclair, NJ; and The High Museum, Atlanta, GA; among others."

          "Paul Kolker presents The Dot is in the Park at the Paul Kolker collection. The exhibition of paintings, prints and light sculptures is an experiment testing how the viewer perceives elemental colors placed one next to the other; and serves as a study for the resultant myriads of optically mixed colors in tints and shades… as well as a spectrum of feelings, which during the process of perception are generated in the viewer’s brain. The lead painting is Kolker’s The Dot is in the Park; a still of a virtual LCD display with Kolker’s dot gridded transformation of Georges Seurat’s Sunday in the Park on the Isle of La Grande Jatte, 1886, currently displayed at The Art Institute of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition’s experiment provides red and blue gel lenses to test the Hering opponent color theory first developed in the 1880s, at the time of Seurat’s painting career. The theory is about sensory pathways from the back of the retina to many parts of the brain. The theory explains how color, particularly opponent colors with darkness and light can affect our mood, feelings and behavior. Today, with brain scanning technologies, synapses light up at the lateral geniculate nucleus; the way station to the cognitive, memory and emotional banks in the brain. In one pathway, blue courses with yellow; in another pathway, red courses with green. The opponent style combinations are also manifested in two types of color blindness; one in red and green color perception; and the other in blue and yellow perception. \r\n\r\nIn Paul Kolker: The Dot is in the Park, fourteen works are curated by the artist and serve to test the viewer’s perception; primarily, as to how color pairings affect our feelings and behavior.

          "Curated by Michelle Grabner\r\n\r\nCUE Art Foundation presents a solo exhibition by Wendy Red Star, curated by Michelle Grabner. Titled Um-basax-bilua “Where They Make The Noise,” the exhibition features manipulated photographs, cultural artifacts, and video footage capturing the Crow Nation’s annual Crow Fair, held since 1904. The exhibition examines the cultural shift away from colonial modes of forced assimilation, documenting a government-sponsored county fair that has been re-appropriated as a vehicle for the revitalization of Apsáalooke (Crow) cultural ways.\r\n\r\nEvery morning during an annual weeklong celebration, members of the Apsáalooke gather along the Little Bighorn River in Montana in a parade that expresses the deep-rooted cultural tradition of movement in Apsáalooke society. Families don traditional dress and display their horses during rituals that recall the migration from summer to winter camps. These parades pass on traditions from horse culture to car culture, from buffalo days to reservation life—weaving each generation into the fabric of a living, resilient tribal Nation.\r\n\r\nRed Star’s exhibition features found photographs and family snapshots arranged as a historical to present-day timeline of Crow Fair over the decades. She manipulates these images to isolate intimate moments, removing backgrounds to focus clearly on the subjects, the detail of their outfits, facial expressions, horses, and parade cars. Accompanying these photographs, Red Star has arranged parade regalia—shawls, beadwork, elk tooth dresses, and blankets—handmade by her relatives and other Crow tribe members. Once draped on horses, cars, or the arms of Apsáalooke women and girls, each shawl shows signs of wear from many journeys around the camp. Sweat stains from horses and grass stains from playful children offer insights into the utilitarian beauty of these objects. Video footage of the Crow Fair shot by tourists and Apsáalooke from the 1970s to 2016 captures the sounds of horse hooves hitting pavement, gossiping parade goers, and the rhythmic jingle of bells as Crow men dance.\r\n\r\nWendy Red Star works across disciplines to explore the intersection of Native American ideologies and colonialist structures, in the past and in contemporary society. Raised on the Apsáalooke (Crow) reservation in Montana, Red Star’s work is informed both by her cultural heritage and her engagement with photography, sculpture, video, fiber art, and performance. An avid researcher of archives and historical narratives, Red Star seeks to incorporate and recast her research, offering new and unexpected perspectives in work that are both witty and unsettling. Her practice also centers on intergenerational collaborative work, which creates a forum for the expression of Native women’s voices in contemporary art.\r\n\r\nRed Star holds a BFA from Montana State University, Bozeman, and an MFA in sculpture from University of California, Los Angeles. She lives and works in Portland, OR. She has exhibited in the United States and abroad at venues including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fondation Cartier pour l’ Art Contemporain, Domaine de Kerguéhennec, the Portland Art Museum, the Hood Art Museum, the St. Louis Art Museum, and the Minneapolis Institute of Art, among others. She has served as a visiting lecturer at Yale University, the Figge Art Museum, the Banff Centre, National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Dartmouth College, CalArts, Flagler College, Fairhaven College, and I.D.E.A. Space in Colorado Springs. In 2015, Red Star was awarded an Emerging Artist Grant from the Joan Mitchell Foundation. In 2016, she participated in Contemporary Native Photographers and the Edward Curtis Legacy at the Portland Art Museum, and recently mounted a solo exhibition as part of the museum’s APEX series. This exhibition marks Red Star’s first solo show in New York City.\r\n\r\nMichelle Grabner is an artist, a writer, and a curator based in Wisconsin. She is the Crown Family Professor of Art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where she has taught for twenty years. In addition, Grabner has also had teaching appointments at The University of Wisconsin, Madison; Cranbrook Academy of Art; Yale Norfolk; Milton Avery Graduate School of Arts at Bard College; Yale University School of Art; and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine. Grabner co-curated the 2014 Whitney Biennial and curated the 2016 Portland Biennial. She is co-artistic director for FRONT International – Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art to launch in 2018. Her reviews are regularly published in X-tra and Artforum. In 2010, Mary Jane Jacob and Grabner co-edited THE STUDIO READER, published by the University of Chicago Press. Grabner is represented by James Cohan Gallery in NYC; Green Gallery, Milwaukee; Gallery 16, San Francisco; Rocket Gallery, London; and Anne Mosseri-Marlio Galerie, Basel. With her husband, Brad Killam, Grabner founded The Suburban in 1999 in Oak Park, Illinois, hosting a range of international contemporary art projects. After sixteen years in the Chicago vicinity, The Suburban began programming exhibitions in two storefronts located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 2009 Grabner and Killam opened The Poor Farm in rural Wisconsin. The Poor Farm is dedicated to annual historical and contemporary exhibitions, lectures, performances, publications, screenings, and alternative free pedagogical programs."

          "GR Gallery presents the exhibition ‘INTERSTELLARIS” by Alberto Di Fabio, Andrea Bianconi and Felipe Pantone; Curated by Alberto Pasini and Francesco Scipioni. The artists are invested in researching and experimenting with hard-edged mesmerizing artworks, that investigate, through pulsating abstract matrixes and optical like patterns, the energy of the universe. The exhibition will feature 15 recent works by the three artists and site specific wall drawings, engaging in a conversation about the infinite possibilities through which the power of astral nature interact with one another.\r\n \r\n“INTERSTELLARIS” aims to exhibit the artistic output of three international, contemporary artists who not only share an affinity for dynamic shapes and a powerful abstract style, but primary tent to depict, though a paradoxically strict and disciplined technique, the vibrating power that rule the cosmos, the movement of the world and ends to reflect on everyday life.\r\n "

        "Description": [
          "Curated by Gregory Volk\r\n\r\nThere is a background for Flair, which includes President Trump. Also the Republican-dominated congress (it seems that every day brings at least one and sometimes several jaw-dropping outrages from Washington); Putin striving to be a new tsar; Erdogan in Turkey angling to be an autocratic new sultan; Brexit with its hunker down, us-against-them, island mentality, and Marine Le Pen in France gussying up a quasi-fascist, anti-immigrant party with virulent anti-Semitic roots. All of this, and a whole climate of resurgent nationalism, populism, racism, sexism, and hostility to others who might look and think differently than “us.” \r\n \r\nThat’s the political and cultural context for Flair, yet this is not an overtly political exhibition, in the sense of presenting artworks that address this or that issue, no matter how pressing and important. It is, however, deeply political in its emphatic belief that art matters a great deal—always—but especially now, when so much of what seems so very good and nutritive is under assault. In this time, when powerful forces are seeking to mold, manipulate, and define culture and consciousness altogether, art and artists (who habitually deal in radical freedom) can indeed be a bulwark and a cathartic inspiration. That’s the premise of Flair: gorgeous, wonderfully idiosyncratic art, confident about its own importance in an era of platitudes, self-serving power, and divisive fear-mongering; art full of risk and driving ideas in this exceedingly difficult time, art chock-full of flair.\r\n \r\nWhereas President Trump’s outlook is fundamentally nativist and nationalistic—America first, make America great again, keep out the immigrants, especially Muslims and Mexicans—Flair is open to the world. All of the artists in Flair are—a very conscious decision on the part of the curator—from elsewhere. All are highly acclaimed artists who have exhibited widely in their home countries and abroad, but only one (German artist Karin Sander) has exhibited extensively in New York. \r\n \r\nAyse Erkmen, who divides her time between Istanbul and Berlin, is widely recognized as one of Turkey’s foremost artists. Her impressive exhibition record includes representing Turkey in the 2011 Venice Biennale, a major one-person exhibition at Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin (2008/09), repeat participation in Sculpture Projects Münster (1997 and 2017), and her one-person exhibition at SculptureCenter in Queens in 2005. For Flair, Erkmen exhibits novel, and altogether delightful, bronze sculptures in very specific colors. She made these works by digging holes in a sandbox, and filling them with molten bronze; because the shape of the holes differed, each sculpture is unique. Patina techniques yielded mesmerizing colors: rose, grayish violet, mandarin orange, blue, yellow. \r\n \r\nPascale Marthine Tayou (Cameroon/Belgium) has also exhibited extensively, including his show-stopping African village/world, made from sundry local materials, in the Arsenale at the 2009 Venice Biennale, and his 2015 solo show at the Serpentine Galleries in London. For Flair Tayou exhibits three of his Poupées (or dolls), small figurative sculptures fashioned from crystal and mixed materials. These are wonderfully hybrid sculptures, fusing European and African elements. Crystal connects with the long history of glassmaking (as well as issues of class) in Europe, while the mixed materials and the look of these sculptures connect with different kinds of African sculptures. Each of Tayou’s Poupées has personality, drama, an almost talismanic force, and real flair. \r\n \r\nGerman artist Karin Sander has had several one-person exhibitions in New York at D’Amelio Terras Gallery and she recently participated in the Serialities exhibition at Hauser and Wirth in New York. She has also exhibited extensively in galleries and museums throughout the world. For Flair Sander exhibits small glass sculptures from a new body of work that jettisons the most basic methodology associated with glassmaking. Instead of fashioning exquisite objects from molten glass, Sander lets the glass do what it wants, so to speak, flowing, spilling, and hardening into shapes (some clear and some colored) that look abstract but also geologic and organic. They are slight, but powerful, and frankly stunning: small sculptures made by world-shaping forces of heating and cooling, flowing and congealing. \r\n \r\nNew York-based Israeli sculptor Reuven Israel is the one artist in Flair represented by Fridman Gallery. His impressive debut exhibition at the gallery was in 2014 followed by solo exhibitions in Los Angeles and Tel Aviv. Israel’s sculptures are largely made from simple MDF (medium-density fiberboard), a commonplace and generally lowbrow particle board. Using this workaday material, Israel cuts, shapes, and sculpts his signature forms, which look simultaneously familiar and completely odd (maybe even like parts of futuristic science fiction machines). He then lavishes attention on them: sanding and polishing them, making their surfaces as smooth and precise as possible, and painting them, in carefully chosen colors, in a uniform way with a spray gun. Israel’s two, quietly marvelous sculptures in Flair feature MDF forms, upright copper tubes, and, with one, two lacquered wood balls on top which also suggest remote planets. \r\n \r\nMargrét H. Blöndal is increasingly recognized as one of Iceland’s top artists, and she has recently had acclaimed solo exhibitions in Reykjavik and Berlin. She is known for understated yet inventive and enthralling sculptures, typically made from scraps and pieces of fabric, plastic, string, rubber, and other materials. She is also known for spare, yet vivid, sensitive, and oftentimes magical drawings made with watercolor, pencil and olive oil (from some perspectives the olive oil has a pronounced sheen, while from others it is almost invisible.) Five of Blöndal’s drawings are exhibited in Flair and they are altogether absorbing and compelling.\r\n \r\nWhen things seem most desolate and whopping problems seem most intractable, art really can provide not only pleasure, but also sustenance and invigoration. That’s what Flair seeks, with eclectic works, full of flair, by five exceptional international artists."

        "Description": [
          "Cavin-Morris Gallery presents the work of two masterful Czech artists, Luboš Plný  (b. 1961) and Anna Zemánková  (1908-1986).   Sixteen of Zemánková’s drawings were included in the Venice Biennale of 2013 under the curatorship of Massimiliano Gioni, and eight of Plný’s collaged drawings are included in the current Venice Biennale organized by Christine Macel.  Both artists have received major world recognition in the last ten years.  Cavin-Morris Gallery has been fortunate enough to have worked with Plný since 2005, and with Zemánková since 1991.  \r\n\r\nIn Walt Whitman’s powerful poem, “I Sing The Body Electric,” he equates the physical body with the human soul.  No matter how microscopically we examine the human body, even down to basic DNA, there remains ultimately a mystery.  That mystery is the repository for the soul.  Plný and Zemánková follow this intuition with similar intentionality, but with very different processes and results. Plný works as a master of physical dissection, creating complex physical beauty; Zemánková approaches her work almost as an animist, infusing corporeal realities with essential manifestations of the soul. \r\n\r\nPlný was in the military when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia simplex, a non-hallucinatory manifestation of the disease.  He was withdrawn and did not desire social intercourse.  On his own he began to study psychiatric and medical texts as a way of coming to terms with his condition.  Plný processed this information in the form of intricate collaged drawings, where he took himself (and those around him) apart layer by layer to observe the workings of the body and mind.  The amount of detail in these large drawings coupled with their beautiful strangeness, soon catapulted him into public appreciation.  In this exhibition we are pleased to present a number of new works by Plný including a large triptych, which is a form of his that has not previously been shown in the United States.  \r\n\r\nZemánková made her deeply pigmented and visionary drawings in a self-imposed solitude in the early hours of the morning. It was a way to combat a deepening and almost crippling depression brought on by the dissolution of her marriage, simultaneous with her children leaving home when they came of age.  All her repressed sensuality and fierce need to nurture came out in these fantastic forms of reinvented Nature.  For this exhibition we have chosen earlier works made before her first public exhibition, well before she began signing her name to her creations.  Anna Zemánková will be presented at the Collection de l’art Brut, Lausanne June 9 – November 26, 2017, in a large solo exhibition that will also feature a catalog in multiple languages.  \r\n\r\nBoth artists sing the intense razor’s edge of exaltation and sheer physicality.  Both work to shape the mundane miraculous.  Both of these artists lived and live intense lives through their art making, and both artists consciously and obsessively sing the Body Electric.\r\n"

        "Description": [
          "ClampArt presents “Brian Buckley: Ghost Ship”—the artist’s first solo exhibition with the gallery.  “Ghost Ship” is an installation of unique, large-scale cyanotype prints. Through the use of a 19th-century photographic process that pre-dates silver-based practices, the artist employs its naturally rich, blue tones to endeavor to express his thoughts on the beauty and mystery of the vast seas and his long-felt fascination with the power and danger of deep waters.\r\n\r\nIncorporating aspects of Greek mythology into the project, the artist uses these stories to express his own personal experiences at sea.  Loosely drawing from the narrative and imagery in The Odyssey—a text taught by Buckley’s father at City College in New York City—the artist’s prints reference ghost ships and sea monsters, sirens and Sappho.\r\n\r\nBrian Buckley sources his chemicals and mixes them by hand in small batches before applying them to watercolor paper.  Often creating layers of multiple coats, the artist covers his sheets with light sensitive chemicals using a variety of tools from sponges to brushes and glass rods.  Buckley plans specific types of applications appropriate for particular subjects, and his hand is evident in and integral to subtle variations in the final artworks. Employing more straightforward photogram techniques in concert with digitally enlarged negatives, each cyanotype is distinct and one-of-a-kind. Exposures range from a single hour up to three full days.  \r\n\r\nBrian Buckley’s work has always centered on analog photographic techniques, celebrating the orchestration of light, chemistry, and papers, harmonizing process and image.   After an eye-opening photography course in college, Buckley quickly threw himself headlong into the darkroom.  His first job was for renowned paparazzo photographer Ron Gallella, printing older work for publication.  Then, while attending Parsons School of Design on a foundation scholarship, the artist began working in commercial labs in New York City.  At Ken Taranto Photo Lab, Buckley worked under master printer Ira Mandelbaum.  He then was employed by photographer Shelia Metzner, managing cross-processed large format Polaroid film.  After later spending a few years as the overnight shift printer for Color Edge in Chelsea, Buckley finally ended up processing work and problem solving darkroom challenges for artist Adam Fuss.  Working with Fuss solidified his commitment to the powerful language of analog photographic processes."

          "Tyler Rollins Fine Art presents Jaonua: The Nothingness &amp; Sanook Dee Museum, an exhibition of two new video works by Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook. \r\n\r\nAraya is one of Southeast Asia’s most respected and internationally active contemporary artists, and for the past thirty years, her video, installation, and graphic works have been regularly shown in museums and biennials around the world, including the Venice Biennale (2005), Documenta (2012), and a retrospective exhibition at the Sculpture Center in New York (2015). Her latest exhibition centers on Jaonua: The Nothingness (2016), a five-channel video installation commissioned for the 2016-17 Singapore Biennale and now making its international debut in an expanded format. It is shown alongside Sanook Dee Museum (2017), a single-channel video exhibited for the first time.\r\n\r\nBorn in Trad, Thailand, in 1957, Araya received fine art degrees from Silpakorn University in Bangkok in 1986 and from Hochschule für Bildende Künste Braunschweig in 1990 and 1994. Her etchings and aquatints of the late 1980s, and her sculptures and installations of the early and mid-1990s, set up themes – death, the body, and women’s experience – that have endured throughout her career. Since the late 1990s, video has been the primary medium of her artistic practice. Still deeply influenced by her earlier sculptural installation work, her videos are imbued with a strong physicality, with a close focus on bodies, often positioned in semi-abstract environments, their aura extending outward into the viewer’s own space. These videos typically imply the presence of an audience that is both observing the action and ceremonially participating in it. They reference traditions of village storytelling, which create continuities between the present and the past, the everyday world and the world of spirits and of legend. Her videos have a meditative, ritualistic quality, inflected by Thai Buddhism, and, like many of humanity’s important rituals, they are often centered on the idea of communication between different realms: between the living and the dead, the insane and “normal” people, humans and animals, the worlds of art and “real life.”\r\n\r\nJaonua: The Nothingness is in many respects a seminal work in Araya’s oeuvre, weaving together thematic strands from throughout her career into a powerfully integrated whole. It is perhaps her most complex video installation to date, with five intertwined video narratives projected onto various objects – including a bed, window, and rug – evoking a highly charged domestic environment in which dreams and reality seem to meld. It is a meditation on what she calls “the inseparable entanglement of things/lives/subjects.” Motifs, even actual video clips, taken from her earlier work, are incorporated into a series of almost surreal narrative fragments informed by Buddhist teachings relating to the nature of suffering, attachment, and karma, alongside musings on Western philosophy of Being. A montage of visual motifs coalesces into a powerful vision of the cycle of life, exploring the nature of attachment in its many forms – whether to sex or eating, to rigid philosophical systems, or even to the sensuality of the art work.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the work of art, and our relationship to it, is probed further in Sanook Dee Museum, a video that continues themes developed in two of Araya’s most acclaimed series, Two Planets (2008) and Village and Elsewhere (2011), in which she placed framed reproductions of iconic Western paintings in rural villages, markets, and Buddhist temples in Thailand, and filmed groups of farmers discussing the artworks, sometimes along with Buddhist monks. With the new video, she brings these participants into a museum, setting the stage for highly animated discussions. All the videos in these related series create a meeting point between apparent oppositions: high art and everyday life; the personal and private spheres; elite and mass culture; art and commerce; East and West. While issues of class and cultural differences, exoticization of the “other,” etc., are invoked, these videos also convey a sense of curiosity, humor, and joy that emphasize a common humanity."

          "ClampArt presents “Lissa Rivera: Beautiful Boy”—the artist’s first solo show with the gallery.\r\n \r\nLissa Rivera’s “Beautiful Boy” portraits revel in gender as a repertoire.\r\n—Stephen Vider, social and cultural historian\r\n \r\nOn the subway one evening, Lissa Rivera’s new friend BJ shared that throughout college he had almost exclusively worn women’s clothing.  However, after taking a professional job, he felt much less free to explore gender.  Lissa, having struggled through her own fraught relationship with the demands of proscribed femininity, suggested to BJ that perhaps photographs might help create a space for him to explore his identity outside isolation.\r\n \r\nLissa writes:  “Taking the first pictures was an emotional experience.  I connected with my friend’s vulnerability.  I wanted to make sure that the images were not a compromise for either of us, and we engaged in many discussions.”\r\n \r\nEventually, Lissa and BJ found themselves falling in love. Now romantic partners, the two are collaborators who have sought to “perform and reshape gender individually and as a couple,” writes Stephen Vider.  Rivera relishes in the visual pleasure an intimate muse can inspire, as so many male artists have experienced historically.\r\n \r\n“Beautiful Boy” investigates a visual language of femininity that is deeply embedded in the DNA of our cultural perceptions. Drawing from Lissa and BJ’s shared interests, the earliest photographs mine the history of 20th-century film, photography, and painting. However, as the project evolved, the images began to flood over boundaries of scripts and sets, and reveal individual experiences of gender, desire, and cultural taboo.\r\n \r\nLissa Rivera is based in Brooklyn.  Her work has received multiple grants and honors and has been exhibited internationally.  She grew up near Rochester, New York, home of Eastman Kodak, where as a child she was exposed to the treasures at the Eastman Museum.  After receiving an MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City, Rivera worked professionally in collections, including the Museum of the City of New York, where she became fascinated with the social history of photography and the evolution of identity in relationship to photographic technologies.  Rivera was chosen as a “Woman to Watch” for the biennial exhibition at the National Museum of Woman in Arts. Selected honors include the Griffin Museum’s Peter Urban Legacy Award; Feature Shoot’s Emerging Photography Award; Photographic Resource Center Exposure 2016; Danforth Museum Purchase Prize; Filter Photo Festival’s People’s Choice Award; and the 2017 D&amp;AD Next Photographer Shortlist.  She is now Associate Curator at the Museum of Sex in Manhattan."

          "Maira Kalman discovered the modest but revered reference compiled by William Strunk and E.B. White and known to generations of aspiring writers and English students at a used bookstore around 2002. She found it so amusing and subject to visual interpretation that it became her most beloved project to date.\r\n\r\nAt the time of publication it also became an original opera written by the young prodigy Nico Muhly in collaboration with Kalman, and commissioned by the New York Public Library. It was performed in the main reading room at the NYPL in October 2005 and subsequently at Lincoln Center and the Dia Foundation in Beacon.\r\n\r\nOf the many paintings that are strategically deployed throughout the book, there are many complex and almost always humorous relationships to the text. Here are three examples; she depicts a romantic couple seated out of doors with the female looking longingly away from her man to illustrate the text about comparative pronouns “Polly loves cake more than she loves me.” A guilty expression accompanies a basset hound in the caption on parenthetic phrases “Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.” The use of a singular verb in the context of a group is demonstrated by the sentence “None of us is perfect”, illustrated by a strangely\r\ndisconnected group of individuals.\r\n\r\nKalman is the author of 25 illustrated books for both children and adults, but this is the one she holds closest to her heart. Many of Kalman’s books have been exhibited at the gallery during the fifteen years we have represented her, including the Principles of Uncertainty, Food Rules, Girls Standing on Lawns, etc., and sold to individual collectors, but Kalman has chosen to keep The Elements together, and we will be offering this body of work in its entirety as one work.\r\n\r\nKalman applies her creative skills to many platforms. She and her son Alex\r\ncollaborated on an installation currently up at the Metropolitan Museum entitled “Sarah Berman’s Closet.” She also recently designed a workout/ performance for the Met, executed a mural for the Russ and Daughters Café at the Jewish Museum, performed as a duck in the Peter and the Wolf production with Isaac Mizrahi at the Guggenheim, designed an installation and exhibition for the newly renovated Cooper Hewitt and is currently working on publications for the NYPL, the Gertrude Stein archive and the Frick Collection. She recently completed a series of three illustrated books for MoMA in collaboration with the photography department and Daniel Handler. She is currently working on a full-length ballet with John Heginbotham doing text, sets, costumes, animations, and performing that premier this summer at Jacob’s Pillow."

          "Lehmann Maupin presents TILL, LIT, Nari Ward’s fourth solo exhibition with the gallery. Ward will debut a series of new work comprised of mixed media paintings, sculptures, and installations. These works examine the ways value is assigned throughout society, with Ward attempting to disrupt existing monetary-based value structures in favor of social enrichment. On the occasion of this exhibition, Ward and Lehmann Maupin will donate a percentage of sales to Housing Works, the New York City-based nonprofit organization whose mission is to end the dual crisis of homelessness and AIDS. \r\n \r\nWard garnered acclaim early in his career with pieces like Amazing Grace (1993), which he produced while in residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem. Ward created a sculptural installation using hundreds of discarded strollers and recycled fire hoses woven to resemble a ship’s hull as a reference to both the history of the transatlantic slave trade and today’s homeless population. The methodologies implemented in this early work can be found throughout his career, with the artist repurposing found objects and placing them in juxtapositions that highlight their functional purposes, cultural associations, and metaphorical potential. Ward lives and works in close proximity to his subject matter: He chooses media sourced from his local surroundings, delicately inserting his own experience in the work. He contributes to socio-political themes, including identity, race, religion, immigration, patriotism, tourism, and consumer culture, by imbuing his work with historic and personal narrative, while intentionally leaving obscured space for open-ended meaning.\r\n \r\nThe works in this exhibition are organized into two distinct material categories relating to the exhibition’s title; the paintings are collectively referred to as TILL, and sculpture and installation works as LIT. The TILL works directly reference commerce. Ward creates these seemingly minimal paintings out of cash register drawers, referred to as tills, surrounded by faint rectangular forms on a background of metallic colors associated with money—gold, copper, and silver. Other large-scale paintings in the series render the pyramid from the back of U.S. $1 bills as a focal point, where the bricks appear to be laid in a frenetic manner that suggests the structure is on the verge of toppling.\r\n \r\nThe size and shape of the rectangles that are repeated throughout the works recall a dollar bill. Indeed, Ward has extracted a thin margin from paper money, a segment so small its removal is undetectable to the naked eye, allowing the altered bills to remain legal tender. Ward gives the paintings a distinct patina by pouring and rubbing white rum in a ritualistic fashion that weathers and removes the pigments, producing an ethereal aura much like a color field painting. Ward treats the word “till” with double entendre in both noun and verb form, representing both a receptacle for capital, and allusion to the hidden or unacknowledged labor required in its acquisition.\r\n \r\nIn the LIT works, artificial lighting is employed to maximum effect. Ward utilizes the exact wattage of the generator-powered floodlights erected by the NYPD on street corners and parks to deter crime. The first piece viewers encounter is a replica of these lights, constructed from collected materials. This light beams across a series of panels that spell out “Reparations,” illuminating the longstanding debate that conflates both economic policy with spiritual atonement for America’s history of slavery and racial subjugation. In another installation, this harsh light flashes at intervals over the low light of candles typically used in street memorials that commemorate the location of a death in the neighborhood. In both pieces, Ward endeavors to bring the experience of living in a community surveilled by the police into the gallery, using everyday objects that create a tangible link to the reality of our current political and social climate.\r\n \r\nIn essence and action, TILL, LIT engages the value systems found in our relationship with currency, with the artist subverting this system to ultimately benefit those who have been undervalued and marginalized economically and socially. While politically minded, Ward is not an activist, but an alchemist, removing a small part of the transactional economy to add tangible value to the social transformation that takes place in art making.\r\n \r\nRunning concurrent with TILL, LIT in Chelsea, Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens will exhibit Nari Ward: G.O.A.T., again, through September 4, 2017, a series of newly commissioned outdoor artworks created on site by Ward, while a recent commission of his piece, We the People, is on view at the New-York Historical Society on the Upper West Side. His mid-career survey, Nari Ward: Sun Splashed, will be on view at The Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston, through September 4, 2017.\r\n\r\nNari Ward (b. St. Andrew, Jamaica; lives and works in New York) graduated with a BA from City University of New York, Hunter College in 1989 and an MFA from City University of New York, Brooklyn College in 1992. Ward’s work has been widely exhibited on an international level, including solo exhibitions at The Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, PA (2016); Pérez Art Museum Miami, FL (2015); SCAD Museum of Art, Savannah, GA (2015); Louisiana State University Museum of Art, Baton Rouge, LA (2014); The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia, PA (2011); Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams (2011); Institute of Visual Arts, Milwaukee, WI (1997); Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, MA (2002); and Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN (2001, 2000). Ward has taken part in important group exhibitions, including The Great Mother, The Fondazione Nicola Trussardi, Palazzo Reale, Milan (2015); NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, New Museum, New York (2013); Nanjing Biennial, Nanjing, China (2011); Contemplating the Void: Interventions in the Guggenheim Rotunda, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2010); Prospect 1, New Orleans, LA (2008); the Whitney Biennial, New York (2006); and Landings, Documenta XI, Kassel, Germany (2003). Ward has received prestigious honors and distinctions such as the The Vilcek Prize in Fine Arts, Vilcek Foundation, New York (2017); Joyce Award, The Joyce Foundation, Chicago (2015); the Rome Prize, American Academy of Rome (2012); and awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Endowment for the Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts, John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, and the Pollock Krasner Foundation. Additionally, he has received commissions from the United Nations and the World Health Organization.\r\n \r\nAbout Housing Works\r\nHousing Works is a vibrant, healing community of people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Our mission is to end the dual crises of homelessness and AIDS through relentless advocacy, the provision of lifesaving services, and entrepreneurial businesses that sustain our efforts. Housing Works is the largest grassroots AIDS organization in the U.S., as well as the largest minority-controlled AIDS organization.\r\n "

          "VENUS present French Bashing, an exhibition of photographs, photomontages and related work by best-selling French novelist Michel Houellebecq, one of Europe’s most controversial cultural figures. Comprising two distinct environments conceived specifically by Houellebecq for VENUS, the show is his first in the United States.\r\n\r\nAlthough Michel Houellebecq (b. 1958, La Réunion, France) has taken pictures for decades, he began exhibiting these images only a few years ago. Houellebecq’s photography is intimately linked to his writing practice, and he often composes scenes in his books while looking at a photograph he shot. At the invitation of Jean de Loisy, the President of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, Houellebecq conceived and mounted his first exhibition in 2016 – an ambitious multi-part presentation called Rester Vivant (To Stay Alive), foregrounding his photography against a dense multimedia narrative that unfolded through a sequence of galleries. For French Bashing at VENUS, Houellebecq has re-conceptualized and tailored two portions of Rester Vivant, completely transforming the gallery’s New York space with darkened walls, engineered lighting, oor coverings, and immersive soundscapes composed in collaboration with Raphaël Sohier.\r\n\r\nFrench Bashing provides two visions of Western Europe as expressed by Michel Houellebecq. On view in the first room at VENUS is a set of photographs that variously depict train stations, tollbooths, apartment buildings, and movie theaters. Hung on darkly painted walls and individually lit with framing projectors, these images assemble a dystopian vision of France familiar from Houellebecq’s novels. Bleakly desaturated, the photographs capture the atmosphere of what Houellebecq calls “peri-urban” zones: despondent suburban areas surrounding larger cities where homes are valued according to their proximity to arteries of public transportation. Houellebecq superimposes lines from his novels and poetry onto some of these photographs. The first image visitors encounter in the exhibition bears the sentence, “It’s time to place your bets,” a quotation from Houellebecq’s poem “The Memory of the Sea;” the right panel of a large triptych bears a phrase from Houellebecq’s 2015 novel, Submission: “I had no more reason to kill myself than most of these people did.” In concert with Sohier’s ambient soundtrack, these enigmatic and provocative bits of language contribute to an ominous feeling throughout the space. Houellebecq’s point is driven home by the image of a crumbling concrete sign of the word “EUROPE,” suggesting a vision of a continent on the verge of decomposition.\r\n\r\nIn the next room, Houellebecq has produced an environment of a distinctly different nature. Here the floor is covered with garish laminated placemats advertising such tourist destinations as St. Tropez and Port-la-Nouvelle. Hung on bright white walls with fluorescent lighting, a group of photographs converge around visions of tourism. Heavily saturated images depict kitschy tour buses, coastal views, and beachside condos in France and Spain. One of these offers an aerial view of a Leader Price discount store that appears wedged into the side of a mountain. Like the images in the rst room, the scenes Houellebecq shows here are eerily uninhabited. But in this well-lit space, elements of the natural world seem to encroach upon disused manmade structures. A brighter soundtrack, also composed by Sohier, fills the space with the sounds of vacation towns: children playing, people laughing, and the audio evidence of merriment in the distance. \r\n\r\nMichel Houellebecq’s reputation as one of France’s most provocative cultural figures has grown over the course of\r\nhis nearly three-decade career, through a series of novels that address subjects as varied as Islam, sexual tourism, and contemporary art. Widely discussed and often hotly contested, Houellebecq is also one of France’s most critically acclaimed novelists. In 2010, his book about the contemporary art world, La carte et le territoire (The Map and the Territory), was awarded the Prix Goncourt, France’s highest literary honor. In 2015, Houellebecq published Soumission (Submission), a novel about the democratic election of a Muslim president who unexpectedly decides to govern the French state according to strict Islamic law. In a macabre turn of events, Houellebecq’s novel was published on the same day as the tragic Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris; in a dark coincidence, that week’s issue of the magazine featured a cartoon of Houellebecq on the cover, alongside the caption “The Predictions of Wizard Houellebecq.” Houellebecq’s production, however, has never been limited to writing, and in 2016, he mounted a widely discussed and extremely well attended exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo called Rester Vivant (To Stay Alive), which featured a sweeping multimedia installation of Houellebecq’s photography, filmmaking, and writing."

          "Curated by Melinda Wang\r\n\r\nEquity Gallery presents Return to Me, a solo exhibition by Margaret Inga Urías. \r\n\r\nUrías presents glass sculptures, ink drawings, installations, and sound that explore the ethereal interconnectedness of existence, over vast expanses of time. Focusing on dust, from the cosmic to the quotidian, the works consider how entire worlds come from and return to this generative substance. If examined closely enough, the dust could tell the story of everything that ever existed.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition functions as a memory archive and cosmic timeline, following the small and the invisible from the beginnings of time, to the here-and-now. Upon entering the gallery, viewers will encounter glass blocks: intricate engravings, carved in thick, scientific glass, that delineate a complete mapping of the universe. Ink drawings on paper trace earthly detritus to their cosmic origins. Glass-panel engravings explore the history of dust particles in interstellar space. A soundscape of the interactions of electromagnetic particles from the solar wind, ionosphere, and various planets’ magnetospheres permeates through the gallery.\r\n \r\nUrías’s art is rooted in research across the sciences, including planetary geology, cosmology, physics, and archeology. Spanning the macro to the micro, Urías presents, through dramatic shifts in scale, the beauty inherent in scientific fact. She examines how infinitesimally small particles connect us to our present, past, and future: how we are born of dust, how we return to it, and how we are all forever connected through it.\r\n\r\nMargaret Inga Urías (b. 1978 in Wrocław, Poland, lives and works in Long Island City, Queens) received her MS from Pratt Institute in 2004 and her BA from Barnard College, Columbia University in 2001. Urías is a recipient of the Chenven Foundation Grant (2014), the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2013), and the New York Foundation for the Arts fellowship in Drawing/Printmaking/Book Arts (2011). She was recently a resident at the Saltonstall Foundation for the Arts Residency in Ithaca, NY (2015) and the Artist in the Marketplace (AIM) program at the Bronx Museum of Art (2014). Her work is held in private collections in the U.S., has been commissioned for permanent, large-scale public art projects, and has been exhibited in galleries, museums, and public venues throughout New York.

          "Pauline Boudry / Renate Lorenz present their first US solo exhibition Everybody talks about the weather… We don’t. It includes a major new moving image work — Telepathic Improvisation — and two new sculptures.\r\n\r\nWith reference to current violent social conditions, Telepathic Improvisation explores the ways in which others (including other objects) might become part of our striving for alternative political and sexual imaginations. Humans and non-humans, movements, speeches, gestures, music, light, and smoke interpret composer Pauline Oliveros’ 1974 score of the same title. While the action of the film appears abstract, it nonetheless includes references to leftist protest, queer S&amp;M club life, acts of surveillance and, finally, fantasies of new relations between human and non-human objects in an interstellar dimension. The audience is called to communicate telepathically with all of the elements on screen, including performers Marwa Arsanios, Werner Hirsch, MPA, and Ginger Brooks Takahashi. Challenging the idea of images as mere depictions of (political) actions, this filmed performance speaks about productive tensions between the fantasy of an action and the action itself.\r\n\r\nArtistic-political methods such as opacity — opposing the principles of rendering the Other transparent — determine the duo’s way of creating installations. With their films and sculptures, and the placement of screens and objects in space, they create a dense net of references to the history of art and the often cruel and excluding history of visualization and the gaze. They play with dis/connections between objects and meaning, and with the conventional gendering of material. Does the hair of a huge sculptural hair-work refer to a wig? Does it refer to the history of drag performance? Or is it a glamorous prop? A minimalist object becomes a stage, and the visitor suddenly participates in a narrative that hints towards an alternative future.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition is presented as part of a year-long series of major presentations by Pauline Boudry / Renate Lorenz in the US, co-curated by Alhena Katsof in collaboration with the Walker Art Center’s Moving Image Commissions, Minneapolis; EMPAC/Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy; PARTICIPANT INC., New York; and the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston (CAMH). Following the film’s premiere and installation at PARTICIPANT INC., it will stream online via the Walker Art Center’s Moving Image Commissions page. The exhibition will be restaged in a new form at CAMH accompanied by a catalogue with a newly commissioned essay by André Lepecki and contributions by the artists, Victoria Brooks, Dean Daderko, Lia Gangitano, Alhena Katsof, and Mason Leaver-Yap.\r\n\r\nPauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz have been working together in Berlin since 2007. Their staged films and film installations often start with a song, a picture, a film or a script from the past. They produce performances for the camera, staging the actions of individuals and groups living — indeed thriving — in defiance of normality, law, and economics. Their films upset normative historical narratives, as figures across time are staged, projected, and layered. Their performers are choreographers, artists, and musicians, with whom they are having a long- term conversation about performance, the meaning of visibility since early modernity, the pathologization of bodies, but also about glamour and resistance.\r\nTheir recent video work, Silent, featuring a performance by Aérea Negrot, premiered at the Biennale of Moving Image in Geneva in 2016. In 2015, I Want, with a performance by Sharon Hayes, was shown in their solo show at Künsthalle Zürich and was commissioned by Künsthalle Zürich and Nottingham Contemporary. In 2014, they produced Opaque, with performances by Werner Hirsch and Ginger Brooks Takahashi, which premiered at the Berlinale (Forum Expanded) in 2015. To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe, In Recognition of their Desperation (2013) is based on the eponymous 1970 score by avant-garde feminist composer Pauline Oliveros, filmed in Funkhaus Nalepastraße, the former GDR radio studios in Berlin, and featuring performances by the musicians Rachel Aggs, Peaches, Catriona Shaw, Verity Susman, Ginger Brooks Takahashi, and William Wheeler. The work had its premiere as part of their solo show at Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe in 2013 and was shown at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in a special event with the artists, Pauline Oliveros, and Gregg Bordowitz in 2014. Boudry/Lorenz’s recent catalogues include Temporal Drag, published by Hatje Cantz in 2011; Aftershow Sternberg Press, 2014; and I Want, Sternberg Press, 2016."

          "Koenig &amp; Clinton inaugurates its new Bushwick location with the gallery’s first exhibition of Brooklyn-based artist, Albert Herter. On view are 45 vividly colored works on paper that have been culled from six discrete series that were drawn over the course of the past year.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with his previous series, Herter’s most recent work features compact and elaborate scenes filled with de-constructed figures that have been staged in a surreal space. Ornate compositions commonly include two or three bodies enmeshed in dialogue or in confrontation. Amidst the dense scape of detail, boundaries between figure and ground, human and nature, threaten to disappear.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance, Herter’s detailed freehand ink and watercolor drawings might resemble those of Old Masters drawings. Closer inspection grants passage through a portal into the interior lives of the cast. Mechanically hinged and dramatically costumed, Herter peels back the surface to render subcutaneous drives and expose competing desires of his characters. Rabelaisian excess reveals the swift accumulation of jouissance.\r\n\r\nDetermined yet vulnerable, Herter’s troupe initially resemble marionettes that are incapable of grasping their own strings, and yet latent potentials seem to lurk in the very framing of the engagement. The frozen scene is one moment of many in which a wide array of vectors move around and through the figure as actors are transformed into actants.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, July 15, Wetware will start to bring Herter’s exhibition to a close with a long-format sound performance. Roxy Farman and Matthew Morandi’s collaborative response to the works on view begins at 6PM.\r\n\r\nAlbert Herter (b. 1980, San Francisco) holds a BFA in new genres from the San Francisco Art Institute, where he focused primarily on video, installation, and performance. His work has also been the subject of solo exhibitions at San Francisco City Hall and Partisan Gallery, San Francisco. Herter has participated in group exhibitions at: JOAN, Los Angeles; Art in General, New York; Derek Eller, New York; Spiral Gallery, Los Angeles; and Arthouse, McAllen, TX. A pairing of the artist’s drawings and writings were recently published by Comfortable On a Tightrope and Museums Press under the title “In the Curtyard: Orchestrated Reduction of the Fantasm”. His drawings have also been featured in The Third Rail and Lacanian Ink. In addition to his artistic practice, Herter is a practicing Lacanian psychoanalyst. He lives and works in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nFor further information please contact info@koenigandclinton.com or call (212) 334-9255. Hours of operation are Thursday–Sunday, 11AM–6PM and by appointment at 1329 Willoughby Avenue in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nArtist Statement: In the OrchORd\r\n\r\n“…(Lacan’s) first formula for the fantasm indicates that it is located in a strictly imaginary dimension: a ← a. Secondly, Lacan points out that the prevalence of an image for a subject corresponds to a lack in the symbolic system. Even though I have no time to develop this now, the idea can already be found in Lacan’s work that when a lack arises in the signifying chain, which can be written as barred A, that an image, an imaginary-level element can become prevalent. Thirdly, and as an example of what I just said, let us take a look at the first way in which Lacan accounts for the figure of the superego. At that time, he said, exactly, that when there is a lack in the symbolic chain that arises from the imaginary level, the obscene figure of the superego appears.” –Jacques-Alain Miller, The Axiom of the Fantasm\r\n\r\n“Man is always given whole, in an image of his creation that he cannot situate in time’s passing. Of necessity, this image is total: man has tools, he works, he imposes sexual restrictions on himself; he has a horror of sexually derived or excremental defilements which is hard to express, just as he has a horror of death and the dead. We shall see, moreover that his aversions are ambiguous, that they allow for reversals. In theory, we must envisage the transition from animal to man as a drama, which we can take as having lasted and as having had ups and downs, but whose unity we must grant. In the beginning there is necessarily, if not a quick drama, then a set of coherent peripeteia; we will never be able to say what happened, but we know the outcome of this drama had the value of an irrevocable decision. This is the true sense of a lasting effect, which extends through time to us, and is till the motive of the activity we pursue.” –Georges Bataille, The Accursed Share Volume II\r\n\r\nAggression is always interspecial and it was an evolutionary boon because it acted as a territorial spacer.\r\n\r\nRitual and sign as a means to avoid slaughter.\r\n\r\nSurface aggression, like the face of the mandrill displaying color and form that appear to carry meaning, to be meaningful as such. The pomp revolves around an axis, fixed lines that count as zero but which, only by their being, define and produce the field and all the action which will unfold upon it. The word came and marked the land and made it into a territory. It marked the bodies and fractured them into anatomy.\r\n\r\nSatirical portrayals of the occasion when the imaginary realm of meaty effervescence was pierced by the symbolic.\r\n\r\nThe orchard is a microcosm or model of a synchronal space, a slice of spacetime without narrative depth or history. It is a flash when a certain contingent word was infused with a charge of libido and became axiomatic.\r\n\r\n–Albert Herter"

Utilizing techniques including photomontage, multiple exposures, combined negatives, brülage, photograms and the disarming juxtaposition of disparate images, the artists created unsettling realities. The artists embraced photography as a new medium in the 20th century in part because of the credibility of photography; the idea that the camera does not lie, lent itself to challenging our assumptions about reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

          "This is the mysterious world of the painter Satoshi Kojima (who should not be confused with the wrestler of the same name even though on occasion there is some crossover.)\r\n\r\nOne may ask what planet have we been lead to as a painting’s title tells us to say good bye to our earth. Maybe the suspension of disbelief required is disconcerting for some but what is portrayed is not altogether unbelievable or even weird. Why? Satoshi has lived in Düsseldorf for the past fourteen years and his work feels infected by the city’s nocturnal world where an anonymous doorway may lead to anomalous gathering that quickly dissolves at the first break of dawn. A place where it’s quite normal for numbered women in lingerie to strike poses in windows on the approach to Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof on the train from Cologne.\r\n\r\nStations, platforms and ‘rooms’ all become stages for action to take place in Satoshi’s painted world with their images rendered in soft pastel buffed in buttery paint with surfaces so soft that it is often difficult to see a hand at play. The paintings are about feelings - feelings about being away from home whilst questioning the notion of home, about grappling with identity, the parameters of sexuality, depression, mortality. Satoshi, an artist perhaps perpetually displaced, lets his paintings speak where words have failed him.\r\n"

          "Jason McCoy Gallery presents its second solo exhibition of Ilana Manolson, featuring a selection of new paintings.\r\n \r\nA botanist and former naturalist for Parks Canada, Ilana Manolson walks through nature on nearly a daily basis. While she used to paint directly from life for years, her recent works are primarily made from recollection. They aim to merge and connect many miles of disparate stretches of landscape, fusing a variety of impressions into a singular image. Skillfully layered, Manolson’s subjects range from views of epic expanse to close studies of nature’s intricate details. Many of these she observes by revisiting particular places repeatedly, making the passing of time a central notion of her work and with that the fragility of existence.\r\n \r\nIt is due to the fact that her compositions are made from memory that another aspect gains importance: subjectivity. In the studio, Manolson edits her experiences and combines glimpses of her visual recollections with her knowledge of the topic. Free to associate and elaborate, she collages information. By the time she makes her first mark, the collected images have become detached from their original context. In a sense, they have been liberated from exact locations or seasonal specifications. Stripped of such concrete indicators, they appear timeless and become iconic representations of nature. \r\n \r\nDespite its contextual ties to the tradition of 19th Century landscape painting, Manolson’s work also relates to contemporary life. Especially, her focus on bringing together a multitude of experiences and visuals in one plane reflects today’s approach to image making and viewing. Without the use of digital technology, Manolson still offers us the possibility of zooming in and out of information, focusing on the abstract movement of a creek and the remarkable detail of a single stalk of grass at the same time. Meanwhile, by working on aluminum panels and sheets of mounted Yupo paper, Manolson favors supports whose slickness can easily relate to today’s flat screens. Her paint is not absorbed by her surfaces, but rather perches on top, assuring an overall sense of fluidity.\r\n \r\nIlana Manolson was born in 1956 in Calgary, Alberta. She received a degree from Goddard College where she studied botany and art (1978), and a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design (1982). She is a recipient of a Massachusetts Cultural Council Artist Fellowship for Painting, a St. Botolph Artist Grant, and an Artists Foundation Installation Grant, to name a few. Institutional exhibitions of her work include the Danforth Museum of Art, Southern New Hampshire University, Tufts University Art Gallery, Concord Art Museum, Boston Public Library, Endicott College, Beverly Gordon College, Ballin Castle Museum, Regis College, and the De Cordova Museum, among others. Her work is in the permanent collections of Museum of Fine Arts Boston; De Cordova Museum; Fuller Museum of Art; Danforth Museum; Boston Public Library; Boston Athenaeum; Ballinglen Arts Foundation and the Berkeley Museum of Art, among others. She lives and works in Concord, Massachusetts and Sausalito, California.\r\n "

          "The first ever exhibition of original Spider-Man artwork by  John Romita and other significant artists including Steve Ditko, Todd McFarlane, John Buscema,  Ross Andru, Gil Kane, Ron Frenz, Keith Pollard, John Romita Jr. and others. \r\n\r\nSpider-Man is the well- known signature character of the Marvel universe; created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko at the nadir of the comics field in August of 1962 in the last issue of Amazing Fantasy #15. Fan reaction was promising and Lee decided to take a chance and published Spider-Man as a stand- alone comic. Unlike the fun, yet two dimensional super heroes of the 1930s and 40s, Lee scripted his new characters with flaws, insecurities, and nuanced personalities. These new style comics proved to be popular with fans, and readers as old as college age began to follow the exploits of these famed but flawed super heroes. \r\n\r\nDitko soon left Marvel and Spider-Man fans wondered who would take over his quirky and often awkwardly drawn hero. Enter artist John Romita. Romita, a graduate of Manhattan’s School of Industrial Art was already a veteran of comics and had worked in the industry since 1947. Overcoming his initial trepidation from taking over a strip that was drawn by the idiosyncratic Ditko, Romita soon ‘stopped trying to mimic Ditko’ and gave Spider-Man and his cast of characters his own warmer, friendlier, appealing and more elegant portrayal which would propel Spider-Man and his cast of well- known characters and villains to worldwide fame and multi-media acceptance as ‘the’ super hero symbol of the ‘swinging ‘60s’ pop culture.  \r\n \r\nRomita’s lush and appealing artwork was also significant as his style soon became the blueprint for what would become the Marvel house look. Indeed, a few years later, in 1973, Romita would become the art director for the entire line of Marvel Comics. Romita’s impact on Marvel Comics in general and on Spider-Man in particular cannot be overstated; much like Walt Disney refined and nurtured a mouse and a house look into a powerhouse brand, Romita assisted Lee in doing much the same, Lee on the words, and Romita on the look of both the spider and the house line. No wonder Disney would acquire Marvel Comics some years later. Romita would be recognized for his contribution to his industry by being inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2002. \r\n\r\nThis exhibition features art from throughout Romita’s initial Spider-Man run. Featured are (‘twice up’) pages from early in the run and their large size and clean presentation are a joy to behold. Significant pages are exhibited here for the first time, including Spider-Man’s battles with the Green Goblin, the Rhino, Doctor Octopus and many others. There are many pages featuring Romita’s beautiful presentation of Mary Jane Parker and Gwen Stacy, including the original early finished drawings. Also featured are the first 2 weeks of John Romita’s amazing Spider-Man strip run as well as several of his earliest larger Sunday strips.\r\n\r\nThere are select pages from Steve Ditko, the quirky creator who gave Spider-Man his oblique beginning with fantastic and detailed layouts and cinematic pacing. Other featured Spider-Man artists will include Todd McFarlane who rebooted Spider-Man’s look in 1988 to much fan acclaim, and notable artists such as Ross Andru, John Buscema, Ron Frenz, Gil Kane, Keith Pollard, and John Romita Jr,  who all contributed their considerable talents in illustrating this iconic character. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition also includes rare art from the original Spider-Man newspaper strip, advertising and other illustrative work. It is the largest, and most comprehensive exhibition of Spider-Man art ever seen anywhere in the world. \r\n\r\nThe art is on loan from the collection of Spider-Man and Romita expert Mike Burkey, and the show is arranged and curated by Comic Art Specialist Rob Pistella."

          "In our current interdependent global economy, the designations “Designed by X,” “Made by X,” “Manufactured by X,” “Made in X,” and “Product of X” are increasingly complex. While their origins are based in trade agreements and intellectual property rights, they also carry weight as symbols of economic protectionism, human exploitation, and ecological malpractice, among other issues.\r\n\r\nRecently, we have witnessed the re-emergence of more “localized” forms of production. Handmade items, arts and crafts, and light manufacturing have made a resurgence in our contemporary product-based markets. Among the reasons for this include responses against the perils of global mass production, reactions to the consumerist philosophies of the 80s and 90s, and the preservation of manufacturing processes and their associated identities of place. Combined with increasing preferences and desires for “artisanal” and “local” goods, these phenomena have changed the way we make things.\r\n \r\nTraveling to remote sites around the world, COMPANY (comprised of Aamu Song and Johan Olin) has collaborated over the last decade with a variety of communities to rethink the processes of making embedded in these places. Applying this knowledge to new and unexpected designs, COMPANY’s work creates an intersection between the mastery of traditional technique and the invention of a new personal and poetic object-specific vocabulary.\r\n \r\nWith an installation of frescos alongside process drawings, research, and new composite objects, Temple of Manufacturing transforms Storefront’s gallery space into a place of sacredness, reflecting the spirit that the duo encountered in sites of production throughout their journey.\r\n \r\n“Designed by COMPANY,” “Made by COMPANY,” “Manufactured by COMPANY,” “Made with COMPANY,” and “Product of COMPANY,” the works presented in this exhibition are built with love and shared with everyone, maintaining a sense of playfulness with an eye toward the ethics of production and global design culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n#templeofmanufacturing      @storefrontnyc      @com_pa_ny\r\n"

          "Pink Genesis, David Benjamin Sherry’s third exhibition at Salon 94, features a group of new photograms that celebrate the transformative potential of the darkroom as an activated, ecstatic space. Enacting a series of performative movements in the darkness, with a virtuoso command of photographic techniques, Sherry has created a group of unique photograms full of saturated color and cosmic depth. \r\n \r\nOver the last decade Sherry has become recognized as one of his generation’s most innovative practitioners of analogue photography, remaining firm in his dedication to traditional processes. He has explored the large-scale American landscape photograph, the physical disruption of the photographic surface, and the changing role of documentary images. His work has been characterized by an ongoing exploration of queer perspectives, and he has frequently used his own body as a subject and site of visual experimentation. \r\n \r\nSince photograms do not require the use of a camera, Sherry’s newest works find him advancing even further into the alchemical heart of photography. Unlike black-and-white photograms, which allow for the use of a minimal amount of light in the darkroom, Sherry’s color versions require complete darkness. While working blindly, Sherry’s years of printing his own work have given him the familiarity and the ability to move through a pitch black room as he adjusts his props––cardboard stencils, his body, sheets of printed acetate, his dog––before exposing the paper to the light of the enlarger. \r\n \r\nHis photograms can be divided into two basic types: precise geometric abstractions and freer, improvisational compositions in which the artist’s body appears as subject.\r\n \r\nTo create the geometric works, Sherry makes hand-cut cardboard templates that he exposes on the paper to light in highly controlled intervals. He uses the enlarger in an unconventional fashion, intentionally misadjusting ratios of cyan, magenta, and yellow to produce extremely vivid colors. The photograms are printed on paper with a deep matte finish, allowing for levels of saturation that often make the surfaces feel more like paintings.\r\n \r\nThe artist’s darkroom performance lends the work an erotic charge. The results are sensuous, luminous forms that evoke otherworldly landscapes and mandala-like visions. While their symmetry speaks to a mathematical rigor, their handmade origins are evident. Imperfections in his cardboard templates leave behind subtly frayed (and thus optically vibrating) transitions between tones. As light passes through a blank negative on its way to the paper below, the edges of that negative are visible in the finished work, thus the artist leaves the word ‘Kodak’ and strings of numbers identifying the type of film stock used. \r\n \r\nFor Sherry, photography is a tool for connecting the entire body to its surroundings. In the new photograms in which his body appears, this intimacy is given literal expression as the artist puts himself in direct contact with the paper, posing on the enlarger table itself. Each of the artist’s movements require both planning and a willingness to surrender to the unpredictable choreography of the moment. Sherry makes use of specially prepared sheets of acetate that incorporate visual patterning drawn from an array of digital sources. Their presence reaffirms the links between technological image production and human physicality.\r\n \r\nMost of the figurative photograms are dense, multi-layered compositions, but Pink Genesis (Self portrait with Mars), 140C0M25Y, 2017 depicts the entire uninterrupted length of the artist’s body in stark silhouette.  The background  surrounds him in a deep shade of pink; on a radiant white rectangle, which appears to be held between his hands, are graffiti-like textures sourced from images taken during a NASA satellite expedition to Mars.  Though photography allows us to see things far beyond the reach of our own eyes, Sherry has made a group of works that celebrate––and are dependent upon––the limitless expanses of touch. \r\n \r\nDavid Benjamin Sherry (b. 1981, Woodstock, NY) currently lives and works in Los Angeles, CA. He received a BFA from Rhode Island School of Design in 2003, and his MFA from Yale University in 2007. His work has been included in Greater New York 2010, at MoMA PS1, LIC, NY; The Anxiety of Photography, Aspen Art Museum, Aspen, CO; Lost Line, Los Angles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; and, What Is A Photograph?, International Center for Photography, New York, NY. His work is in permanent collections at the The Nasher Museum of Art, Durham, NC; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN; Wexner Center of the Arts, Columbus, OH; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; and the Saatchi Collection, London, UK. Earth Changes, a catalogue of Sherry’s landscape work, with an essay by LACMA curator Britt Salvesen, was published in 2015 by Mörel Books, London.\r\n "

          "“I wish for my work to be as vividly present\r\nand yet as elusive as “woman” herself\r\n– not simply because she is veiled or turns away–\r\nbut because she is still in progress.”\r\n- Lalla Essaydi: Crossing Boundaries, Bridging Cultures (ACR Edition, 2015)\r\n \r\nLeila Heller presents Still in Progress, the first solo exhibition in the Middle East by the New York-based Moroccan artist Lalla Essaydi. Spanning her major bodies of work from 2003 to 2013, the exhibition includes work from series including: Converging Territories, Harem, Les Femmes Du Maroc, and Bullets Revisited. Essaydi’s photographs are the result of a complex performance-based process comprised of painting, calligraphy, interior design, costume design, stage directing, and finally photography. This meticulous process of image making is crucial to Essaydi’s oeuvre. The uncropped white borders of the film emphasise that she fabricates her settings and identities, mocking the Orientalists’ invented fantasy scenes, yet hers are based on historical, social, and cultural facts.\r\n \r\nIn the series, Converging Territories (2002-2004), Essaydi develops a unique working method and set of visual devices that include applying a deliberately indecipherable calligraphic form alluding to Kufic script using the medium of henna to her subjects’ faces, bodies, and environments. In the series that followed, Les Femmes du Maroc (2005-2007), Essaydi arranges her subjects in poses directly inspired by 19th century Orientalist imagery reminiscent of paintings by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eugène Delacroix and Jean-Léon Gérôme.\r\n \r\nEssaydi uses intricate calligraphic text drawn in henna instead of ink to fill everything from the walls to the fabrics her Odalisques wear. This layer of calligraphy conceals the uncovered parts of the female bodies and in this sense assumes an allegorical dimension: even their bare skin becomes her canvas as she covers their ankles, legs, arms, wrists, and faces in row upon row of tight script. What is key here is that the art of calligraphy itself is traditionally a male-dominated realm, yet Essaydi appropriates it with the ultra-feminine medium of henna  (used by women to create decorative patterns for special occasions such as weddings). “By reclaiming the rich tradition of calligraphy and interweaving it with the traditionally female art of henna,” she explains, “I have been able to express, and yet, in another sense, dissolve the contradictions I have encountered in my culture: between hierarchy and fluidity, between public and private space, between the richness and the confining aspects of Islamic traditions.”\r\n \r\nIn the Harem series (2009), Essaydi continues to explore many of the themes characteristic of her earlier work, but in an entirely new setting: the harem quarters in Dar al Basha, a vibrant architectural palace in Marrakesh. The artist designs fabrics for the subjects that mimic the patterns within the palace, picking up on details from the mosaic, stucco, stained glass, and carved wood. Through this combined use of space, calligraphy, henna and costume, Essaydi explores the function of women as decorative features within the context of vernacular architecture. She explains, “The women then, become literal odalisques (odalisque, from the Turkish, means to belong to a place).” As such, she is portrayed “caged” amongst other acquisitions in the “cabinet de curiosite” of the male dominion, the harem. This very physical and psychological environment of the home and harem haunts the artist, in the sense that it constitutes the space and the culture of her childhood within her.\r\n \r\nIn Harem Revisited (2012-2013), Essaydi’s subjects are clothed in elaborate caftans and their environments are now covered with richly adorned fabrics. These vintage textiles, which were created between the 17th century to the early 20th century for use in wedding ceremonies, to decorate palaces and the harem area, were all generously loaned to Essaydi from the Nour and Boubker Temli collection.\r\n \r\nCoinciding with the Harem series, Essaydi began Bullets and Bullets Revisited (2009-2014). Upon closer inspection, however, every item, from clothing to the walls, is made up of carefully cut and polished bullet casings. The use of this unexpected material, and one that’s charged with associations with death and violence in contemporary society are juxtaposed with Essaydi’s historical scenes, rendering them as objects of beauty within these delicate tableaux. In these series, thousands of bullet casings are meticulously sewn together to create a mantle of gold that is draped from ceiling to floor. Essaydi productively uses the bullet as a disturbing metaphor with its continued relevance. In this later series, we see a shift in Essaydi’s aesthetics, as she moves away from the bounds of traditional architectural spaces to a new Byzantine-like luxury showcase-like space where beautiful Odalisques are adorned in shimmering materials against equally dazzling mosaic backdrops giving an aura of warm-hued wealth and luxury. Here, Essaydi has lifted her veiled beauties out from their backdrops very much puts them at the forefront, glittering and glimmering in all of their glory. It is this military juxtaposition of carefully cut and polished bullet casings that builds up these glamorous trompe l’oeil images. Despite this apparent blinding beauty, where ammunition is even hand sewn on the models’ clothes, jewels, and beds, Essaydi explains that “beauty is quite dangerous, as it lures the viewer into accepting the fantasy” yet she brings the viewer into a much more perilous world — that of the contemporary moment with its current and on going war and destruction.\r\n \r\nLalla A. Essaydi (1956) grew up in Morocco and now lives in the USA where she received her MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts/TUFTS University in May 2003. Recent exhibitions of her work have been staged at The Smithsonian Museum of African Art in Washington DC; The Baku Museum of Modern Art in Azerbaijan; The World Art Bank Program, Washington DC; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Bronx Museum, New York; the Tampere Art Museum, Finland; Bahrain Museum/Ministry of Culture; Williams College Museum, Williamstown, Mass.; Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio, and the Bahrain National Museum, Manama, Bahrain. Her work can be found in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; The British Museum, London; The Louvre, Paris; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, Qatar; and The Art Institute of Chicago, among many others. In 2015, ACR Edition released her monograph, Lalla Essaydi: Crossing Boundaries, Bridging Cultures.\r\n"

        "Description": [
          "303 Gallery presents its fourth exhibition of new works by Ceal Floyer. Floyer’s phenomenological readymades, often subject to bewilderingly simple semiotic inversions that have the power to re-route perception, have made her a key figure in post-conceptualism from the late ‘90s to the present.\r\n \r\nFor this exhibition, Floyer presents new works in video, photography, and sculpture. In “Plughole” (2017), a static camera is trained on a standard 6-hole bathroom sink drain. The video depicts a stream of water that is redirected in an attempt to fill each hole perfectly with the flow of the faucet, moving from one hole to the next. The drain’s function as a receptacle for water becomes a kind of short-circuit, as water itself becomes the material that plugs its own pathway. This transference of states is a recurring motif in some of Floyer’s most effective work with manmade interventions into natural experience, as seen in her now seminal “Light” (1994) or “Overhead Projection” (2006). Simple phenomena are exploited for their most basic physical malleability, and coaxed to create counterintuitive or impossible paradoxes laid bare and envisioned in real time.\r\n \r\nAlso on view extending the length of the gallery is “Domino Effect”, a narrow row of black wooden blocks lined up to form a kind of miniature wall in the space. Set in a tight row, the domino effect (of these pieces falling onto each other in a beautifully cascading mathematical arrangement) becomes not only a physical impossibility but a symbolic one as well, as these small wooden pieces in a way cease to be dominoes at all according to their current configuration. An object’s elucidatory intention gone haywire is seen again in “Newton’s Cradle,” a typical balance ball / pendulum set that you would find in an elementary science class, or as a stress relieving ‘toy’ classically found on an executive’s desk. The gambit in this case is that all the balls are tangled into a post-stress knot. Again Floyer subverts the object’s ability to explicate itself, instead fashioning it into a kind of allegorical straitjacket that is nonetheless elegant in its own new permutation. “Conversation Piece” bookends the exhibition, a set of quotation marks bracketing the gallery space at the entrance and exit, not only poking fun at the mounting of an exhibition, but the rhetoric around it - including the reading of this text.\r\n \r\nCeal Floyer was born in 1968 and lives and works in Berlin, Germany. She completed a BFA at Goldsmiths College, London, UK (1994). Solo exhibitions include Aspen Art Museum (2016), Aargauer Kunsthaus, Switzerland (2016), Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany (2015), Kolnischer Kunstverein, Germany (2013), DHC/ART Foundation for Contemporary Art, Montreal, Canada (2011), Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami (MOCA), USA (2010), Palais de Tokyo, Paris, France (2009), KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin, Germany (2009) and MADRE, Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Donna Regina, Naples, Italy (2008). Among many group exhibitions, she has participated in the Manifesta 11, Zurich (2016), the Guangzhou Triennial, Guangdong, China (2012) and documenta 13, Kassel, Germany (2012). She won the Preis der Nationalgalerie Fur Junge Kunst, Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, Germany (2007) and was nominated for the Nam June Paik Art Centre Prize, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany (2009)."

          "Half Gallery presents a dozen new oil paintings depicting Daniel Heidkamp’s recent travels from Boston to Brooklyn. The paintings shown here are part of a larger dialogue which will be presented concurrently in the group exhibition Talking Pictures at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \r\n\r\nIn Talking Pictures, the museum invited 12 pairs of artists to create a visual correspondence over the course of six months. Heidkamp teamed up with White Columns alum Cynthia Daignault, documenting their individual forays up and down the Eastern seaboard (Daignault hailing from Baltimore, Heidkamp a Massachusetts native). The artists used a private online folder to upload paintings they made during their road trips. \r\n\r\nHeidkamp’s journey begins in Copley Square, a Boston landmark named for the renowned American painter John Singleton Copley. His exploration took him to the rugged coastline of Cape Ann made famous by the paintings of Edward Hopper, and then later on to the rural New York area that is home to the Hudson River School as captured in Heidkamp’s painting Pink Olana. At times Heidkamp’s subject matter becomes more personal. In Hawk Watcher, Daniel portrays a visit to his familial home where his father examines a massive hawk perched in their front yard. In this painting the monochromatic palette creates the feeling of a memory painted in real time. \r\n\r\nAs the exhibition title suggests, his travels conclude at home in Brooklyn. Whether painting the view of two ferries crossing at dusk from his studio window or taking walks under faint New York City starlight - he is seeking new vantage points amidst familiar surroundings. By painting in his adopted domain, Heidkamp considers how the definition of ‘home’ shifts throughout life, and how personal histories intersect with cultural touchstones that we inherit collectively. \r\n\r\nWhile the entirety of Heidkamp’s contribution to Talking Pictures encompasses some thirty paintings - full documentation of which can be seen at The Met until December 2017 - Half Gallery is pleased to share a dozen works by Daniel Heidkamp in Boston to Brooklyn. \r\n\r\nDaniel Heidkamp (b. 1980) graduated from The Museum School in Boston and currently resides in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. \r\n"

          "The Kravets Wehby Gallery presents Hi-Res, a summer group exhibition including works by Alison Blickle, Asad Faulwell, Allison Zuckerman, Sydney Chastain-Chapman, Wendell Gladstone, Aya Uekawa, Jamea Richmond-Edwards, Stan Narten, James Busby, and Tylonn Sawyer.\r\n \r\nAlison Blickle’s feminine dreamscapes invite the viewer into her personal narratives of motherhood, spirituality, and mythological depictions of women. Stan Narten’s meticulously rendered abstractions reference sci-fi and heavy metal from the 1970s and 1980s. Picasso and Matisse are woven through contemporary feminism in Allison Zuckerman’s outrageous hybrid paintings and sculptures. Aya Uekawa’s delicately rendered figures carefully blend her Japanese heritage with the current experiences of women from around the world. Tylonn Sawyer’s dramatic paintings depict the dystopian reality of modern life in America. James Busby’s rich geometric abstractions employ a delicate use of color and line to create intense, high-definition paintings. Asad Faulwell draws from contemporary Middle Eastern history to create complex collaged paintings of political figures and revolutionary women. The androgynous figures in Jamea Richmond-Edwards’ delicately collaged paintings are simultaneously exposed, resilient, and optimistic. Sydney Chastain-Chapman’s vibrant and garish depictions of the awkwardness of daily life are uncovered through her ironic narratives. Wendell Gladstone seamlessly weaves abstraction and figuration into dreamy portraits that mirror themselves.\r\n "

        "Description": [
          "Lyles &amp; King presents TT52, a two person exhibition of new paintings by American artist Trudy Benson and textiles by the French artist Yann Gerstberger. In recent paintings, Benson has shifted her focus from the representation of digital image making techniques to new forms of painted-collage which emphasize the phenomenon of experiencing painting. Since moving to Mexico City in 2012, Yann Gerstberger has been making tapestries based upon his natural and cultural surroundings. The exhibition title is the archeological reference for the burial site of Nakht, an ancient Egyptian official; while Gerstberger’s vibrant, coded language recalls Egyptian wall painting, TT52 also suggests the excavational mode of looking required for deciphering both artists’ designs.\r\n\r\nMade with oil paint applied either with a roller or straight from the tube, Benson’s collage-like paintings layer abstract, impastoed forms above a spray painted ground, which diffuses the visual equivalent of static noise through the tiers of the image. Contrast is key: each layer is discretely striking because Benson mixes a variety of colors and forms as well as temporal references, so that scribbled lines evocative of primitive computer drawing tools mingle with a jumble of jazzy, Matisse cutout-like shapes. In Benson’s jungle of styles, each layer performs via its interactions. Looking at her paintings involves experiencing not only its sensual dynamics but also a new approach to space and time in painting.\r\n\r\nGerstberger’s colorful and rugged tapestries, made by inserting market sourced fabrics among hand-dyed mop-head strands glued to a vinyl surface, proposes craftsmanship itself as an image making technique. Gerstberger’s visual language is a mostly vernacular one, referencing the comic Fábulas Pánicas, by the Chilean-French artist Alejandro Jodorowsky, and the European fantasy of the tropical, but it also draws from and continues the modernist tradition of his native France. Gerstberger’s works have a haptic quality, owing to the thickness of the cotton threads which encrypt the image by lowering, as it were, its resolution.\r\n\r\nAlong with Benson, Gerstberger’s approach highlights two aspects of the artists’ contemporary sensibility. His assimilation of modernist imagery into a Mexican domain (or vice versa) complements Benson’s stylistic mashups. Then, though Gerstberger’s forms are clearly legible from afar or from a photograph, like Benson’s spray paint, the texture of his works interferers in reality with the image’s communicative ability. The aesthetic correspondence between these artists enables their affinities in thinking about art history and image rendering to also come to the fore.\r\n\r\nTrudy Benson (b. 1985, Richmond, VA) received her MFA from the Pratt Institute and lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. In 2017, her work was featured in exhibitions at Galerie Bernard Ceysson, Paris, and Ribordy Contemporary, Geneva. Recent projects include Spooky Action at a Distance, Half Gallery, New York; Shapes of Things, Lisa Cooley, New York; and Post-Analog Painting, The Hole, New York, among others. Benson is represented by Galerie Bernard Ceysson and Ribordy Contemporary.\r\n\r\nYann Gerstberger (b. 1983, Cagnes sur Mer, France) graduated from the school of Fine Arts of Marseille-Méditerranée and lives and works in Mexico City. In 2017, his work has been exhibited at Michael Jon &amp; Alan Gallery, Miami, and Galerie Perrotin, Paris. Recent projects include Guerre du feu style, Sorry We’re Closed, Brussels; Decorum, Musée d’Art Moderne, Paris; and Terremoto Globo Grnnnd, Le Confort Moderne, Poitiers, among others. Gerstberger is represented by Sorry We’re Closed and Michael Jon &amp; Alan."

          "“Inappropration” by Sam Tufnell’s much anticipated first major NY solo show. Tufnell, an SVA graduate, exploded on to the art scene a few years ago with his unique style of visually appealing yet underlying satirical illuminated sculpture., After selling out consistently  at major art fairs, his first Museum show last year (where a piece was stolen!), numerous public installations, such as Gnome Mountain, and getting into the hands of some major collectors, we realized the time was right for “Inappropration” . \r\n\r\nTufnell will create a totally immersive illuminated environment that will encompass the whole unlit gallery space. The process of looking at the art in this setting cleverly becomes an almost HD experience from a visual perspective.  The subject matter of the work will be a mini retrospective of the different series that have been been a hit for Tufnell over his career. as well as new unseen works created for the show.  \r\n\r\nThis will be our biggest show of the year, pieces are already selling from shots on social media, we are very proud and excited to hold this exhibit, definitely one not to miss."

          "Jack Shainman Gallery presents The Coffins of Paa Joe and the Pursuit of Happiness, two inter-related shows at the gallery’s Chelsea location and The School located in Kinderhook, NY.\r\n\r\nServing as the centerpiece of the large-scale exhibition, The Gold Coast Slave Castles of Paa Joe honor the Ghanaian legacy of abebuu adekai, or fantasy coffins. The ornate sarcophagi celebrate death and the afterlife, sculpted in the form of objects representative of the deceased and their interests. In the 1950s, abebuu adekai were used only by chiefs and priests, but more recently have become a growing trend in surrounding areas of Ghana, attracting the attention of contemporary art museums and galleries worldwide. In 2004, Claude Simard, the late co-founder of Jack Shainman Gallery, commissioned thirteen coffins in the form of European castles erected along the Gold Coast in the 15th century, which served as holding pens for America-bound slaves. These sculptures memorialize the captives in the custom of abebuu adekai, and recall the bleak American history that helped to integrate human suffering with Western tradition.\r\n\r\nPaa Joe transforms the practical coffin into a work of art, and he, as the carpenter and craftsman, becomes a custodian of the spirit. This transcendental shift from the material to the metaphysical is the point of convergence for the works included in this exhibition. From the earliest artifacts on display, decorative Neolithic Chinese pottery, to the most contemporary works by Nina Chanel Abney, David Altmejd, Kerry James Marshall, and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, to name a few, the artists presented here address in their own distinct way the notion of art as celebration, as a vehicle for personal salvation, or more broadly, creating beauty out of—or despite—one’s surroundings. This diverse collection of works and objects reflect the wide-ranging influences that guide the gallery’s program.\r\n\r\nThe universal drive to make art facilitates opportunity to reflect on the complexities of existence, offering perspectives of possibility, hope, and freedom, and a departure from the mundane. Bringing together works and objects from across historical period, culture, or geography, the exhibition presents the religiously inspired 17th century oil paintings of Francisco Pacheco to the Fauvist works of Jacques Villon, the anti-Nationalist drawings of George Grosz to the gregarious busts of John Ahearn. These artworks from past and present express the joys of making and collecting, excavate lost narratives, and explore timeless themes that recur throughout history, from portraiture, to the motif of the Trinity and the enduring story of David and Goliath.\r\n\r\nConcurrently on view this summer through September 24, 2017 is If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day: Collections of Claude Simard at the Tang Museum at Skidmore College, which presents a parallel exhibition from the collection of the gallery’s late co-founder. Acquired both abroad and from within the United States, the diversity of the works spans an extensive range of medium, to country of origin and subject matter."

          "Castor Gallery Downtown presents Nature, an exhibition of new work from artists Jeanette Hayes, Michael Manning, Austin Lee, Patrick Jacobs, Robert Lazzarini and Jonas Lund. Nature will explore  artworks that are all rooted in mathematics, algorithms, code and modern technology which continue to push the barrier on the ever changing landscape and definition of traditional artworks. Different mediums include data mining apps, neural networks created to produce artworks, evolving and updated streaming websites, 3D printed artworks, Social Media video collages, and intricate sculpture works that are achieved through current technological advancements.  \r\n\r\nJeanette Hayes: (b. 1988) Known for her collage-like aesthetic, Hayes uses mixed media to build a bridge between high and popular culture. Her Renaissance and Baroque paintings are interfered by internet icons and anime characters. Hayes is based in New York and has designed graphics for Proenza Schouler as well as made video installations for Alexander Wang.\r\n\r\nMichael Manning: (b. 1985, New York, USA) Manning is an LA-based artist who explores alternative approaches to producing and distributing traditional art objects using technology and social networking. Through mixed media, he juxtaposes touch screens with canvas art, incorporating new media into traditional art forms. Most recently, he has had solo presentations at monCHERI Gallery (Brussels), Gavlack Gallery (Palm Beach, FL), and Last Resort Gallery (Copenhagen). He has also had an ‘100 Paintings’ book published by CURA for Los Angeles Art Book Fair.\r\n\r\nAustin Lee: Lee is a New York-based, international artist with an MFA in Painting from the Yale School of Art. While his computer-based graphics retain corporeal properties, his abstract figures are “dissociated from the tangible”, making them incomparable to anything in the real world. By using mixed media such as paint, digital drawing tools, and even sculpture, Lee is creating expressive and colorful contemporary art with a comical cartoonish emotion to it. His pieces are usually large, painted with bright, opaque colors and covered with a gloss matte to make them glow. Previously, Lee has had solo exhibitions at Postmasters (NY, USA), Carl Kostyal (Stockholm and London), and Kaleidoscope (Milan, Italy).\r\n\r\nPatrick Jacobs: (California, USA) With an MFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Jacobs is now based in Brooklyn, where he creates hyperrealistic miniature looking glasses showcasing glimpses of natural world. He presents his work like a scientific exploration, using a variety of materials to vividly portray elements of nature. Jacobs has also created a large installation piece of a distorted corner of an apartment. He has done several solo shows, the last being at Pierogi Gallery (NY, USA).\r\n\r\nRobert Lazzarini: (b. 1965, New Jersey, USA) Based in New York City, Lazzarini is concerned with the ambiguity in interpretation of art as well as the conceptualization made by spectators. His work has frequently featured the motif of death but most commonly, distortion. Inspired by the minimalist art movement, Lazzarini makes sculptures of common objects and transforms them into distorted visuals, interfering with the instinctual interpretations of the viewer. The unfamiliarity of the distorted object captures the viewer’s‘ gaze as they try to find meaning in the work. Lazzarini uses an algorithm to create sine-wave distortions composed of intersecting sine-waves, making an image that our eyes cannot focus on completely. He has shown his work at the Whitney Museum (NY, USA) as well at the Hirshhorn Museum (Washington D.C., USA).\r\n\r\nJonas Lund: Lund is a contemporary Swedish artist who uses mixed media to explore how we are influenced by the digitization of the world. While he exposes our dependence on new technologies, he also invites the audience to play interactive games testing their tolerance for the overdose of information that is received online. Online technologies simultaneously simplify and complicate human experience; they have the potential to promote human connection, but they can also dematerialize real meaning. Lund is an avid experimenter of multi-media platforms and digital tools and even streams some of his experiments live. He has had solo exhibitions in London, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, New York, Paris, Istanbul and Rio de Janeiro.\r\n"

          "THE GRAND EMBRACE, featuring the work of Grandpa George Herms and Granddaughter Myranda Gillies. The exhibition will be on view at Susan Inglett Gallery.  Years in the making, the exhibition will feature woven wall hangings, jewelry as sculpture, and sculpture as jewelry. Drawn to civilization’s refuse, both Myranda and Grandpa George find beauty in the commonplace, each gifted with the alchemist’s touch. Their shared history is clear and shared vision undeniable. \r\n\r\nWhen Grandpa George began his work in the Fifties, America was well into a Golden Age of Consumerism. Madison Avenue was King and the measure of a man’s worth was his stuff. The natural by-product of stuff is more stuff and consequently the streets of San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York were awash in debris. George Herms and his peers mined the sidewalks and dustbins for the building blocks of their work. Just as George pieced together his poetry from the odd yet perfect word, he did the same with his sculpture recycling beauty and meaning from America’s castoffs. \r\n\r\nFollowing in her Grandfather’s footsteps, Granddaughter Myranda Gillies seeks the extraordinary in the ordinary. Exploring the streets and bodegas near her Brooklyn home, Gillies sources both man-made and natural fibers along with strands of plant life. Pineapple fronds, lemon grass, sugar cane, plastic mono-filiment and commercially dyed fibers all find their way to her loom. Beyond the plastic mono-filiment and commercial fibers, the natural elements are all cultivated and imported from faraway lands, sourced to satisfy a community that hungers for a taste of home.  In weaving a portrait of her New York block, Gillies has woven a much wider and far more inclusive web, a picture of our contemporary American life.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition will also feature a special selection of jewelry designed by Gillies using rusty metal scraps - Herms sculptural discards, along with pearls, dyed silk tubing, and cut metal.\r\n\r\nMYRANDA GILLIES (1984) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She holds her BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Gillies has exhibited in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Portland. This is her first time exhibiting with her grandfather.\r\n\r\nGEORGE HERMS (1935) lives and works in Los Angeles, California. Herms’ work has been exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA; The Whitney Museum of American Art, NYC; The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; and the Museum of Modern Art, NYC. He has received three fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts; a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in Sculpture; the Prix de Rome Fellowship in Sculpture from the American Academy in Rome; the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation Award; and was a visiting scholar at the Getty Research Institute. His work is included in collections at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN; the Menil Collection, Houston, TX; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA. \r\n\r\nJoin in the conversation with Susan Inglett Gallery, Myranda Gillies and George Herms on Instagram (@SusanInglettGallery), Facebook (@Susan Inglett Gallery), Twitter (@inglettgallery), and via the hashtags #MyrandaGillies, #GeorgeHerms and #SusanInglettGallery."

          "Figureworks presents Meridith McNeal’s latest series Inside/Outside: Windowphilia. This fascinating work explores hidden and complex layers connected with daily reflections.   Created with the fluidity of ink and watercolor, these altered perspectives are inviting and engaging.\r\nLisa Peet, Associate News Editor at Library Journal, reviewed the exhibition:\r\nWindows, in particular, invite a multiplicity of meanings. Add a reflective surface, so light can work its magic, and you bring a sort of graceful confusion: what is on one side can coexist with what is on the other, the space behind and before the viewer overlaid. Where you have been shows itself side by side with where you are, or where you may yet be going.\r\nMeridith McNeal’s work brings that particular magic into play elegantly. Her precisely composed paintings offer a series of images that explore what it is to be on one side or another—or one side and another. It can be done, and McNeal’s paintings show us how."

          "Greenpoint Terminal Gallery presents Hunting for Punchlines. The exhibition brings together new work by three artists: Morgan Blair, David Pappaceno, and Jason Silva. The artists are mismated through medium, but share a similar lexicon characterized by sudden moments of disjointment and replacement. The artwork in the show explores abstraction through fragmentation, and reflects on how patch-working and reconfiguring moments can heighten allegory. The title, Hunting for Punchlines, acknowledges that even though the stories jump around, they also find their right endings. \r\n\r\nMorgan Blair’s paintings are characterized by digital palettes and artificial textures similarly associated with design software. The work  originates from online memorabilia, drawing from Youtube, tutorial videos, Seinfeld episodes, Craigslist finds, elementary blogs, and miscellaneous net trash. She chooses stills that move from recognizable images to abstractions. Her paintings reflect similar stylistic jolts, jumping from renderings of regular to irregular shapes and oscillating flat to three dimensional spaces. Equivalently, David Pappaceno’s sculptures cut &amp; paste. Playing with pattern and texture, Pappaceno transplants body parts onto geometric and organic forms resulting in sculptures that double as tantalizing mythic idols. Pulling inspiration from art history (specifically the seductive Venus of Willendorf) the works,  futuristic in form, are simultaneous reminders of the past. The graphite drawings by Jason Silva  exist as patterns, narratives, and surrealist landscapes. The subjects in his work each carry their own relationship to light and shadow, making it seem like, although they co-exist in one drawing, they might have pulled been from different worlds.  As a whole, this exhibition collects work that is inspired by a  cross section of pop culture and historical references; all of which are restructured by the art making process.\r\n\r\n[Image: Morgan Blair “14 Real Life Billionaires You Won’t Believe Really Exist and Decide the Fate of the Free World on Behalf of the Cast of ‘The Real World: Middle Earth,’ Including Fashion Santa, Big Pharma, Whoever Starred In ‘Maniac Cop 3,’ an Actual Ghoul, and a Cartoon Evangelical Kangaroo!

          "Chiaozza is the collaborative name of the artistic duo Adam Frezza &amp; Terri Chiao. Their practice integrates a relationship between color, structure and play. Chiaozza explores these notions primarily through sculpture, but also painting, ceramics, design and installation. For their first solo exhibition with the gallery, Chiaozza have focused on wall-mounted objects where new interactions of light, color and materiality can be explored.\r\n\r\nThe strength of Chiaozza’s work emanates from their independent backgrounds. Adam Frezza trained in studio art, making whimsical paintings on panels. Terri Chiao initially trained and worked in architecture, leaving the profession to construct playful wood cabins. An early example of this was A Cabin in a Loft: a wood cabin built inside the Brooklyn loft that remains their home &amp; part-time studio. In the realm of fine art, Frezza &amp; Chiao are able to balance a quirky color theory with an acute sense of structure and design.  \r\n\r\nOne example of their process is the Lump Nubbin series, which could be described as imaginary desert plants and cacti. Small in scale, this ongoing series is based on paper pulp forms, made from their own studio scraps. Brilliantly painted, the amorphous sculptures are often combined with strips of painted paper and set on concrete bases. Frezza &amp; Chiao have now freed these sculptures from the pedestal, allowing them to sit directly on the wall. This transferal increasingly blurs the distinction of the object as sculpture or painting. Chiaozza continue this thought process with their series of paper pulp paintings. As opposed to the Nubbins, these works take the flat, rectangular format that one associates with paintings. However, they still retain a topological aspect in their surface. At times they float out from the wall, which allows the colors that adorn their backs to engage the wall as a pigmented halo that stretches out beyond their borders.\r\n\r\nIn the Shapeless Shapes series, thin wooden strips undulate around wooden pegs attached to the wall. One side of the strip is painted, and the other stained, so that the presence of a glowing hue on the wall lends a sense of “inner” and “outer” to each flat, wave-like form. These works are complemented by another series of wood and paint wall sculptures. These are composed of wood slabs, both straight lap-joined and steam-bent into curving arcs, all of which intersect throughout the object. The interior compartments that emerge are also brightly colored, and their chromatic glow is divided and accentuated by the painted edges of the planks. Once again, Chioazza’s work falls between the categories of painting, sculpture and design.\r\n\r\nFrezza &amp; Chiao were recently commissioned by the Coachella Festival to create “Chiaozza Garden”, an acre-sized dreamscape of large scale, fantastical plant sculptures and floating islands. Wall Works brings the duo’s vision back down to a relatable scale, while allowing them to further both the investigation and adaptation of the materials that they enjoy playing with so much."

The works consist primarily of welded iron and steel, powdercoated grey andadorned with detail elements of colorful blown glass. The artist forges her ambitious, abstract forms from busy, entwined networks of black metal strips, more visually reminiscent of contour drawing than sculpture. Their generously sized structures are intended to constrict, re-frame and challenge navigation of the space.\r\n\r\nNigoghossian’s practice relies on the counterbalance of several apparent paradoxes. The works’ gestural, often erratic shapes seem to undermine the industrial materials’ integrity. Compositionally, the sculptures echo the approaches of German Expressionist painting and drawing, while sharing other aspects of their manufacture and aesthetics with Minimalism and Process Art. Their formal elegance and seeming intentionality is controverted by the experimental nature of the artist’s making, the trial-and-error approach demanded by her mode of production. Furthermore, the sculptures’ initial impression of near-mechanical material austerity is undermined by a closer inspection, which reveals roughly welded and soldered jointing and visible copper wires, clear evidence of the artist’s hand. \r\n\r\nNigoghossian intends these works for outdoor display, and accordingly conceived of the exhibition as something that strains against its containing walls, pushing towards the outside world. The conflation and juxtaposition of indoor and outdoor, organic and inorganic, is a crucial aspect of her practice. The sculptures’ forms were loosely inspired by a species of rare shrimp, whose bodies have both transparent and opaque elements, as well as complex and visible jointing and skeletal systems. Likewise, the artist seeks to build three-dimensional mass from lines, to turn void to density; the works’ empty spaces feel equally substantial to the heavy metal contours. \r\n\r\nThe show’s title, Exotica, refers to a genre of American music popular in the 1950’s and 60’s, which glorified the non-native experience of Southeast Asian and Oceanic cultures; the musicians were suburban Americans, and their impressions of the distant locales were purely fantasy, based on Western culture’s representations, rather than actual encounter. Nigoghossian’s own work, likewise, stems in part from a desire to create foreign objects from a familiar lexicon, to fabricate idiosyncratic, alien forms while referencing and employing established Art Historical modes of expression – which vary from Brutalist and Deconstructivist architecture, to Baroque painting, to Modernist European drawing, to the Abstract Expressionist sculpture of John Chamberlain. \r\n\r\nJo Nigoghossian has exhibited widely in galleries both in the United States and abroad. This is her first exhibition at Team Gallery.\r\n"

          "Gitterman Gallery presents an exhibition of sculpture by Joe Gitterman. \r\n\r\nThis exhibition marks the first time in over 13 years of exhibiting connoisseur photographic art that Gitterman Gallery will show sculpture.\r\n \r\nThe artist’s name might seem familiar since he is the father of the gallery owner, Tom Gitterman.\r\n \r\nJoe Gitterman, who turned 80 last year, has sculpted for 50 years. Yet it wasn’t until he retired from Wall Street that he devoted full time attention to his art. Since his first exhibition at a local Connecticut gallery in 2011, Joe Gitterman’s career has taken off. His work has been bought by both private and corporate collections and he has received commissions from Robert Couturier, Norwegian Cruise Lines, The Riverside Building in London, the Robert A.M. Stern designed Arris building in Washington D.C. and the Four Season’s Hotel in Houston, among others.\r\n \r\nGitterman’s sculpture was initially inspired by a love of ballet and modern dance. He states, “I thought about the movements of the dancers as a series of frames in an old celluloid film, and how just one of those frames could convey a fantastic sense of motion. I thought that capturing this ‘single frame of motion’ in a solid piece of sculpture would be a wonderful challenge.”\r\n \r\nSculpting maquettes in copper, wax or acrylic, Gitterman chooses to cast in bronze or fabricate in stainless steel. His work ranges from intimate hand size pieces to dramatic work well beyond human scale. The surface texture and color of each piece accentuates either dynamic movement or sensual form. Whether they are clean crisp stainless steel or bronze with a leather-like patina or a vibrant yellow knot, they are abstractions and gestures; they are about fluid form.\r\n \r\n “I can’t think of a more perfect exhibition to venture into sculpture with, a tribute to my father and his art. He has been an inspiration to me to follow my passions and now I get to share his with others.” —Tom Gitterman\r\n\r\n"

          "Steven Harvey Fine Art Projects presents the first New York City one-person show of paintings by Susan Lichtman, entitled In My House. Lichtman’s paintings describe interiors with figures drawn from her life. The paintings in this exhibition were part of her recent show at The Eleanor D. Wilson Museum in Hollins University, in Roanoke Virginia, a component of her tenure as the 2017 Frances Niederer Artist-in-Residence at Hollins.\r\n \r\nJennine Culligan, Director of the Eleanor D. Wilson Museum, writes in the exhibition catalog, “Since 1987, the first floor of her home, her large studio a few steps away, and the daily comings and goings of her family have been her main source for compositions based on observation and imagination. She and her husband, painter Dennis Congdon, built their house and studios in the woods of southeastern Massachusetts on land adjacent to the property where Lichtman grew up. This rural home has become her center of place, and family, her muse.”\r\n \r\nLichtman is an intimist. in an interview with Larry Groff of Painting Perceptions she states, “I’ve always painted interior spaces, and am …  influenced by all the European and American painters of domestic interiors, from the De Hooch and Vermeer, to Hopper and Porter. When I was young I saw the large Vaquez murals by Vuillard in the Petit Palais. I thought they were the most remarkable things I had ever seen. I still love Vuillard and the Nabis, Bonnard and Gwen John.”\r\n \r\nLike Vuillard and Bonnard, Lichtman is a subtle colorist par-excellence, creating complex harmonies on a large scale. She states “To me, close-valued color is magical. It’s a way for the paint to imply the fiction of light and air. A palette of close values also gives the picture a kind of envelope into which everything is placed.”\r\n \r\nDespite the apparently autobiographical details of her paintings, Lichtman is engaged in constructing a purely fictive space. She remarked, “painting needs to put forth an event, or an idea, that is purely visual.” In Rosa Moves Out we see a girl in a leather jacket on the verge of leaving home. Yet the central pictorial incident is the interplay between a grey-yellow chair and the extended wood stove pipe and grill. In Cookout the narrative interplay is contained within the  reflections in a radiating yellow door frame.\r\n \r\nSusan Lichtman is an Associate Professor of Painting at Brandeis University. Select recent shows include: List Gallery, Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA, Smith College, Northampton, MA, The Bannister Gallery at Rhode Island College and the Lenore Gray Gallery, Providence, RI as well as many other venues.\r\n \r\n"

Beyond the Ban celebrates this dynamic tradition of diversity in American art by showcasing the stunning contributions of one of the immigrant groups targeted by President Trump’s travel ban.\r\n\r\nProceeds will benefit the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a non-profit based in New York City. The exhibit demonstrates the rich stylistic and thematic variety of art being produced today by the vibrant community of Iranian artists living in the US. \r\n\r\n"

          "“Many artists have felt the lure of juxtaposing photographs and text, but few have succeeded as well as Teju Cole. He approaches this problem with an understanding of the limitations and glories of each medium.”—Stephen Shore\r\n\r\nSteven Kasher Gallery presents the first solo exhibition in the United States of acclaimed photographer, essayist and novelist Teju Cole. The exhibition features over 30 color photographs from the series Blind Spot, each accompanied by Cole’s lyrical and evocative prose. These works comprise a n image/text diary of years of near-constant travel. The exhibition accompanies the publication of Cole’s fourth volume, Blind Spot (Random House, 2017) with a foreword by Siri Hustvedt.\r\n\r\nIn the Blind Spot photographs, we see what Cole has seen: a park in Berlin, a mountain range in Switzerland, a church exterior in Lagos, a parking lot in Brooklyn. We are drawn into the texts, which function as voiceovers, and which complicate Cole’s already enigmatic images. At stake here is the question of vision, an exploration Cole began following a temporary spell of blindness in 2011, and which he presents here in a photographic sequence of novelistic intensity. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition also presents Black Paper, a visceral photographic response to Cole’s experiences following the election of November 2016. This continuously evolving, large-scale work explores buried feelings, haunted space, and all that can be seen through darkness.\r\n\r\nTeju Cole (b. 1975, Nigeria) is a writer, art historian, and photographer. He is the photography critic of the New York Times Magazine and Distinguished Writer in Residence at Bard College. He is the author of three previous books. His novella, Every Day is for the Thief (2014), was named a book of the year by the New York Times, the Globe and Mail, NPR, and the Telegraph and shortlisted for the PEN/Open Book Award. His novel, Open City (2011) won the PEN/Hemingway Award, the New York City Book Award for Fiction, the Rosenthal Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Internationaler Literaturpreis. Open City was also shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the New York Public Library Young Lions Award, and the Ondaatje Prize of the Royal Society of Literature. His essay collection, Known and Strange Things (2016), the core of which is his photography essays, was published to rave reviews in the New York Times and the New York Review of Books, among others; named a book of the year by the Guardian, the Financial Times, Time Magazine, and many others; and is the only book to have been shortlisted for two PEN Awards in the same year: the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay and the PEN/Jean Stein Award for originality, merit, and impact.\r\n \r\nCole’s photography has been exhibited in India, Iceland, and the US, published widely, and was the subject of a solo exhibition in Italy in the spring of 2016.  His photography column at the New York Times Magazine was a finalist for a 2016 National Magazine Award. He is a recipient of a US Artists award, and received the 2015 Windham Campbell Prize for Fiction.\r\n "

          "Garvey|Simon presents Daisy Craddock: Summer Produce, an exhibition of oil pastel diptychs fresh from the studio, by Daisy Craddock. Her subjects’ flavors and fragrances can be sensed right away, and though these works appear to be minimalist squares of color from a distance, they are decidedly realist in nature. With skin on the left and flesh on the right, the diptychs display a subtle yet detailed complexity that is created from layers of scumbled and polished oil pastels and oil sticks. Whether from a farmstand upstate or a neighboring city deli, the fleeting nature of each edible specimen is palpable in Craddock’s delicate surfaces.\r\n\r\nHer palette ranges from the rich purple of eggplant beside its smoky green-tinged ivory flesh, to the striated greens of watermelon with a juicy gradated pink interior. The exhibition explores the full range of nature’s color spectrum with an immediacy that both activates the senses and conveys a modernist nostalgia.\r\n\r\nThis is Craddock’s seventeenth show in New York City and third solo show with Garvey|Simon. It is also marks the first time Craddock has included a selection of her small preparatory studies in oil pastel and oil stick. These will be on display in the secondary gallery as an intimate peek into the artist’s process.\r\n\r\nDaisy Craddock (b.1949, Memphis, TN) received a BA in Fine Arts from Rhodes College and an MFA in Painting from the University of Georgia. Her work has been exhibited widely throughout the United States. Recent one person shows include the Fischbach Gallery in New York City in September, 2014, and John Davis Gallery in Hudson, NY in September, 2015. Her work has been reviewed in Art in America, The New York Times, Art &amp; Antiques, American Artist, Art News, and Arts Magazine. Public collections include the Anderson Museum, the Newark Museum, the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, the Milwaukee Museum of Art, the Roswell Museum, the Rubin Museum of Art, and the Weatherspoon Museum. She is the recipient of a Roswell Artist in Residency and a 2002 New York Foundation for the Arts, New York Arts Recovery Grant. The artist lives and works in New York City and in upstate New York."

          "Tibor de Nagy presents “Scavenge” a one-person exhibition by Medrie MacPhee that will inaugurate the new location of the gallery at 11/15 Rivington St.\r\n\r\nThis body of work presents a significant shift for MacPhee who is known for her use of architecture and architectural forms to create narratives around the ideas of a dystopian future/past.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, MacPhee began a fake fashion line (RELAX) out of cheap discount clothing. The premise was total comfort in a fraught time. Sweat suits were cut up and reassembled into one piece outfits with multiple zippers, buttons, notions, other fabrics, decorated hoodies. A recent piece of hers - “The Precariats” - is included in a group exhibition “99 Cents or Less” curated by Jens Hoffman at MOCAD Detroit from May 19 to August 6, 2017.\r\n\r\nGradually what had been a “fashion” sideline began finding its way into the paintings. Sometimes the clothing fabric is a detail in a larger painting and other times it covers the entire surface.\r\n\r\nMacPhee sees the notion of scavenging as an existential premise especially suited to the demands of the moment.\r\n\r\nAlthough the paintings are non-depictive, the identifiable “real” things (zippers, buttons, notions and clothing) in combination with the painted surfaces have created something fresh and elusive. The painted structures, collaged elements and large flat acrylic transfers relate to the architecture of language. What we experience as the pauses and gaps, the presence and absence, and the subterranean feeling and instinct that lie under words is equally manifest in the visual realm. \r\n\r\nMedrie MacPhee was born in Canada and moved to New York in 1976.  MacPhee’s numerous awards include an Anonymous Was a Woman award (2016), an American Academy of Arts and Letters Purchase Prize (2015), a Guggenheim Fellowship in Fine Arts (2009), New York Foundation For The Arts (1998), and a Canada Council Established Artist Grant (2004). Her work is in various public collections including the Metropolitan Museum, The National Gallery of Canada, The Asheville Museum, The Palmer Museum of Art, The Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal. MacPhee is an artist-in-residence at Bard College.\r\n"

          "Rawson Projects presents its second solo exhibition with Icelandic artist Lilja Birgisdóttir. Love Me Back will present a new body of photographic and sculptural work that explores the disconnection between our virtual self and embodied existence. \r\n\r\nAs our consciousness is expanded and extended into our phones, our subjectivity and sense of self is now increasingly performed on various social media platforms. As we tread forward into the unknown, our rapidly growing digital consciousness and identity is in competition with our embodied sensorial experience of the world. \r\n\r\nIn a seemingly endless ocean of information and the restless chatter of social media we can curate and edit our lives. At what point does this virtual identity not just define but obscure and even damage our real life self? Trauma and loss now have digital consequences that compound suffering. After a painful breakup there can be very tidy erasure as images of past lovers vanish from accounts and our sights forever. \r\n\r\nWho then is the ‘real’ me, in my physical presence in the here and now, armed with my immediate sensory experience of the world?\r\n\r\nBirgisdóttir’s previous exhibition at Rawson Projects If your colors were like my dream (2015) received positive reviews in both The New York Times and Modern Painters.\r\n\r\nLilja Birgisdóttir studied photography at the Royal Academy of Arts, The Hague, Netherlands and received BA in fine art from the Iceland Academy of the Arts, Reykjavík, Iceland in 2010. Recent solo exhibitions include 8 Storms at the National Gallery of Iceland as part of The Icelandic art Festival (2016) and Moment Gone at Ultra Super New Gallery, Tokyo, Japan (2016). Birgisdóttir was the composer and conductor of the The Vessel Orchestra, the opening act for the Reykjavík Art Festival in collaboration with the captains of Reykjavík Harbour in May 2013. Since 2010, she has been a member of Kling &amp; Bang, an artist run gallery in Reykjavík where in 2011 she founded Endemi, an art magazine about Icelandic contemporary art.\r\n"

          "Curated by Dr. Aliza Edelman\r\n\r\n“In each picture we create a problem and the picture is the solution.”\r\n- Judith Lauand\r\n\r\nDRISCOLL BABCOCK GALLERIES presents Judith Lauand: Brazilian Concrete Abstractions, our second survey devoted to this renowned artist, and an opportunity to examine the enduring contribution of this distinguished figure of postwar abstraction and Latin American art. Lauand (b. 1922, Pontal, São Paulo) was a formative participant in the longstanding Brazilian constructivist project, which included the remarkable careers of her female Brazilian contemporaries, particularly Lygia Clark, Lygia Pape, and Mira Schendel, all of whom have attained international critical attention. In a similar light, Lauand has emerged internationally as an artist who negotiated the social constraints of her position as a woman and the innovative painterly strategies she defined in the rational discourse of Concretism.\r\n\r\nLauand’s abstractions are a carefully calibrated reading of line, shape, and space, and her authorial application of the language of geometry is equally guided by objectivity, mathematical rigor, and precision. In the 1950s, her aesthetic syncretism with São Paulo-based Concretism provided her opportunities to exchange ideas and exhibit as the only female member among the prominent group of artists who formed the avant-garde movement called Grupo Ruptura. In her use of a constructive vocabulary, Lauand, like many of her paulista colleagues, turned to the influential ideas and works of Max Bill and Josef Albers.\r\n\r\nThis survey explores six decades of the artist’s practice from the 1950s through 2008, presenting significant examples of the artist’s early experimental use of synthetic and industrial materials, modular grids and serial latticework, radiating vertices, and optical and illusory patterns. The circles cut into the enamel surface of CONCRETO 33 (1956) amplify the use of black, red, white and green as a dynamic template. Lauand’s sustained investigation of geometrical systems is evident in the loose generation of shapes and structures that are subsequently developed in multiple versions in sketchbooks, lithography, drawings, and paintings. The expanding and contracting spirals in CONCRETO 66 (1957) are methodically examined in both gouache and linocut on paper as well as enamel on particle board. The logarithmic spiral, with its capacity to form infinite rotations, also appealed to Lauand because it suggested an intuitive visualization of rendering temporal experience and space. Lauand’s unwinding rays in DO CÍRCULO À OVAL (FROM THE CIRCLE TO THE OVAL) (1958), utilizing paint and stucco on board, draws upon Waldemar Cordeiro’s delineation of the scientific properties of spirals in his important series Idéia visível (Visible Idea). A colorful radial pattern returns in Lauand’s SEM TÍTULO (UNTITLED) of 2001. Even as the artist revisited her principle set of shapes throughout her career, Lauand’s liberating approach to the structural and theoretical framework of Concretism has expanded our definition of the historical term rupture.\r\n\r\nLauand participated as one of the first gallery monitors or docents at the now celebrated II São Paulo Biennial, held from late 1953 to early 1954. The second biennial—the international exhibition with over thirty-two participating countries from Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Asia—also coincided with the commemoration of the city’s fourth centenary at the newly constructed Ibirapuera Park by the seminal Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. In the same year, Lauand declared her commitment to Concretism’s principles that were intent on determining a new concept of reality aligned with the practical developments of modern design, architecture, and machine aesthetics.\r\n\r\nLauand had her first individual exhibition in 1954 and subsequently participated in historic group shows, including the III Bienal de São Paulo in 1955-56; the I Exposição Nacional de Arte Concreta (1st National Exhibition of Concrete Art) in 1956; and the international retrospective on Concretism, Konkrete Kunst: 50 Jahre Entwicklung (Concrete Art: 50 Years of Development), organized by Max Bill in Zurich in 1960. Lauand was the subject of a major retrospective, Judith Lauand: Experiências (Judith Lauand: Experiences), at the Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo in 2011, and the recent survey, Judith Lauand: os anos 50 e a construção da geometria (Judith Lauand: the 1950s and the Construction of Geometry), at the Instituto de Arte Contemporânea, São Paulo, in 2015."

          "CANADA presents Tomorrow Tomorrow, a group exhibition featuring Demian DinéYazhi’ and Noelle Sosaya, MK Guth, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Kristan Kennedy, Evan La Londe, Charlie Perez-Tlatenchi, Michelle Ross, Storm Tharp, and Heather Watkins. These nine artists are preoccupied with physical abstraction, changeability, and working with materials to shape space with emotional purpose. Hailing from Portland, Oregon, the artists are part of a highly collaborative artistic community with a history of migration, mysticism, indigenous strength, and literary soul-searching.\r\n\r\nThe receptivity and endurance of textiles plays a critical role in the conversation. Michelle Ross’ fabric-based paintings and color studies flatten and rescale the body in queer, feminist geometries. Kristan Kennedy’s un-stretched linen paintings ritualistically absorb and express raw experience as they knot and billow across walls. Heather Watkins’ muscular, suspended sculptures of cotton cord and India ink infuse space with a wild poetics of flow and stasis. Demian DinéYazhi’ and collaborator Noelle Sosaya work with textiles and product languages to disseminate a radical queer indigenous vision of sacred reflection and punk activism. Jessica Jackson Hutchins’ table-top sculptures are cryptic worlds where bits of clothing, metal letterforms, and ceramic vessels become stages for new feminist myths and blessings.\r\n\r\nAlongside the resilience and spiritual subtext of the woven, other artists in the exhibition explore the human form and its environment as a complex of inner experience and outer presence. Storm Tharp’s field of thirty-six portraits and color-field abstractions combine painting and printmaking to redraw subjectivity as a space of persistent transformation. Charlie Perez-Tlatenchi’s tiny collages on gridded paper descale strip-mall signs and awnings into miniatures for reimagining immigrant experience. Evan La Londe’s pigment-based photographs snare beauty and perception toward philosophical questions of knowing and appearance. MK Guth’s instruction-based piece creates connections between the rest of the art in the show and will turn the gallery into a temporary communal space full of optimism and exchange.\r\n\r\nWe wish to thank Sarah Miller Meigs and the Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery at Reed College for their support and collaboration.\r\n\r\nTomorrow Tomorrow is curated by Stephanie Snyder, the Anne and John Hauberg Curator and Director of the Cooley Gallery, and Wallace Whitney. The title of the exhibition comes from a song by Portland musician Elliott Smith.\r\n"

          "Ulterior Gallery presents a two-person exhibition of works by Rachel Grobstein and Margaret Meehan. \r\n\r\nRachel Grobstein and Margaret Meehan’s works occupy the uncertain but suggestive zone between non-fiction and fiction. The artists draw directly upon artifacts and ephemera both contemporary and historical to create works that both reference and float free of their original sources.\r\n\r\nRachel Grobstein will exhibit a wall-scaled installation of her miniature sculptures of disposable objects: cardboard boxes, trashed paper cups, a crumpled pizza box, etc., all reduced to a size that can sit in the palm of your hand. Recreated as small-scale sculptures, Grobstein’s objects are almost beneath notice, yet possessed of a significance and permanence that they did not have as mere items of “junk.” Grobstein says, “For me, there was a perverse logic in inverting the readymade status of unhappy objects back to the handmade, to reassert longing and intimacy.” Arranged on the wall as an installation, these tiny objects form a landscape of human activities.\r\n\r\nMargaret Meehan’s ceramic sculptures and cabinet-card collage works are inspired by the persona of the fashion designer Coco Chanel, who was at once iconic for her modern designs and controversial for her political views and her activities during World War II. Chanel’s designs freed women from corsets and elided distinctions between the sexes; she was also an anti-Semite and a collaborator with the Nazis. Elements of Meehan’s collages and parts of the figures she depicts are directly sourced from Chanel advertisements and designs. Meehan develops “models” from these details, and combined with her interest in otherness, states of being in-between, and the discomforts of being a self, they become creatures whose existence seems to hover between Chanel’s two disparate personas. They are monstres sacré in which multiple identities are spliced into one.   \r\n\r\nRachel Grobstein graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2013 and has lived and worked in New York since 2013. She is currently participating in the Roswell Artist-in-Residence program in Roswell, NM. She has been awarded a Studios of Key West artist residency in Key West, FL (2016), a Vermont Studio Center Full Fellowship by the Joan Mitchell Foundation, Johnson, VT (2012), and the Siting Prize for a site-specific installation at the RISD Museum (2013), Providence, RI.\r\n\r\nMargaret Meehan received her MFA from the University of Washington in Seattle in 1999 and currently lives and works in Richmond, VA. Her works have been exhibited at: Flowers Gallery, London (2016); Artpace, San Antonio, TX (2014); The Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, TX (2013); and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, TX (2007). She has been the recipient of numerous grants and residencies including: the Nasher Sculpture Center Microgrant (2015); The Lighthouse Works Fellowship, Fishers Island, NY (2013); Bemis Center, Omaha, NE (2009); and the Dozier Travel Grant, Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, TX (2008).\r\n\r\n[Image: Left: Rachel Grobstein, installation view, 2017.

          "Kustera Projects presents Off to a Rocky Start, an exhibition of new work by Nicasio Fernandez. This will be the artist’s debut solo exhibition with the gallery.\r\n\r\nNicasio Fernandez’s application of slapstick humor and cartoonish imagery intertwine chaos and order, inventing a dialogue that is solely imaginative. Off to a Rocky Start takes a thematic trip into the past; visualizing prehistoric life as a zany affair. The odd, occupying figures are intellectual simpletons who mix moments of ineptitude with cerebral clarity. In this world, the tools created are a means of leisure and entertainment. In the painting “Still Getting Around” a legless, figure has mounted a gator and uses a motivation stick to aimlessly enjoy a stroll on the beach. Displays of dominance, trickery, violence, bawdy situations, and more adorn Fernandez’s complex canvases.\r\n\r\nChaos and order are not only essential to the imagery but integral to his physically involved process. Thin skins are glazed for spatial features, details and illusionary effects. Copious amounts of paint are meticulously extruded in luscious layers onto the surface only to be cut into, shaved and sanded to achieve a surreal quality. The lucid globs of paint Fernandez has formed into rocks, tools, strange distorted figures, among other things, begin to exit the confines of the canvas into our dimension; vacillating the viewer’s position between voyeur and participant in the action.\r\n\r\nNicasio Fernandez was born in 1993 in Yonkers, NY, and received his BFA from the School of Visual Arts in 2015. His work has been exhibited at the SVA Chelsea Gallery, Kustera Projects, Lesley Heller’s Workspace, Field Projects, Stella Elkins Gallery, Spring/Break Art Show, Art Athina, and 0-0 LA. He currently lives and works in Yonkers and Mahopac NY."

          "Kentler International Drawing Space presents Patterning: Selections from the Kentler Flatfiles, curated by Samantha Friedman, Assistant Curator in the Department of Drawings and Prints, The Museum of Modern Art.\r\n \r\nFeaturing approximately forty works by eight artists, this exhibition explores the persistence of pattern in contemporary drawing. The diverse selection of works reflects the influence of nature and mathematics, calligraphy and technology. Using materials both mundane and ephemeral, opulent and ornate, these artists build compositions that range from the reductive to the baroque, proving in the process that pattern often has a purpose.  \r\n \r\nThe Kentler Flatfiles, a collection of 2,000 works on paper by over 250 artists, has been an essential element of the gallery since its founding in 1990. The Flatfiles are regularly featured in guest-curated exhibitions as well as traveling shows, and are an important resource for artists, curators, scholars, collectors, and all those interested in the field of drawing. The collection is available to the public for viewing by appointment and is cataloged in the Kentler Flatfiles Digital Archive on our website: www.kentlergallery.org.\r\n "

          "Jim Kempner Fine Art presents a two person exhibition of paintings by Shalin Ye and KAORUKO. \r\n\r\n￼Shanlin Ye creates figurative watercolors that explore the coarse, imperfect and aberrant side of human existence. Seeking to express the natural beau- ty of the female body in exuberant moments of daily life, Shanlin utilizes the reflective and ethereal nature of watercolor to depict these ephemeral moments. On exhibit will be selections from her Day Dreamer series, a se- ries of colorful figurative works featuring unusual scenes of individual lives, each depicting a sweet secret, hidden desire or wild fantasy. There will also be works from her Reflection series, a series of black and white portraits that explore the mysteries of the human face. In a representational abstract style, Shanlin superimposes finely detailed patterns and images over emo- tionally charged portraits. Born in China and now living in St. Louis, Ye’s work was recently selected as a national juried competition winner for Paperworks 2017, selected by juror Akili Tommasino, Curatorial Assistant at the Museum of Modern Art.\r\n\r\nFormer teenage pop star KAORUKO explores the identity of Japanese women at a crossroad between traditional and contemporary life. In her paintings she depicts languid women in contemporary domestic spaces, set against traditional kimo-\r\nno patterned backgrounds. She uses silkscreen to copy the 300 year old kimono patterns. Expressing feminism as a positive element in her work, the paintings in this exhibition reference pop culture and traditional Ukiyo-e Japanese woodblock printing, which uses flat, defined areas of color and subtle color gradation. Her images celebrate the strength and determination of the Japanese idol (pop singers), subverting the fragility and cuteness of female sexuality that is preferred in Japa- nese society. Born in Nagoya, Japan, she currently lives in New York."

          "It’s not always possible to sort out fact from fiction, but to believe that everything is a lie is to know nothing.\r\n\r\n—Jill Lepore, “The World That Trump and Ailes Built,” The New Yorker\r\n \r\nAlternative facts are lies. Fake news is propaganda.\r\n\r\nBoth are indicative of the aestheticization of politics that Walter Benjamin warned against. The media is tightly molded and controlled, beginning in the White House Press Office and algorithmically landing in our feeds. The truth is exaggerated with ideological results in mind.\r\n \r\nalt-facts is a politically charged response to today’s mediascape. Spanning both gallery spaces, the works therein propose that the politicization of aesthetics—propaganda’s opposite—can offer profoundly powerful alternative truths.\r\n \r\nArt condenses its message into objects; meaning is extrapolated. It lends itself to constructing fictions: Painting is illusion. Sculpture is fabrication. Virtual reality is unreal reality. In alt-facts, conceptual and material interventions produce fictitious narratives, alternative histories, objects and images both real and virtual. Poetic license does not have evil intent. It is a departure from reality because reality bites. Hello, you’ve reached the winter of our discontent.\r\n \r\nIf fiction is more credible than truth, and if building a world only requires making things up, we are equipped to build the world we want. \r\n\r\nMeriem Bennani’s FARDAOUS FUNJAB, Episode 1 (Pilot): Fardaous is a mock reality show—the perfect format for a constructed and scripted reality—that follows the life of Fardaous, the designer behind the hijab of the future: the Funjab. With over 700 designs, the Funjabs featured in the video have pockets, double as tennis baskets, come equipped with a bluetooth device, and even work as mechanical hair extensions. Your Year, a printed lightbox, reads like an ad for the designs. \r\n\r\nTwo paintings by David Diao feature in the exhibition. 40 Years of His Art takes the invitation design from Picasso’s retrospective at MoMA in 1940, curated by Alfred H. Barr, Jr., the only change being Diao’s name appears in lieu of Picasso’s—and, of course, that Diao’s show never happened. Dancing pictures a costumed Diao posing in front of Matisse’s Dance, as one might expect a 20th century Matisse to appear. Self-deprecating and earnest, Diao playfully portrays himself as canonized artist. The silkscreened square image operates a geometric formal device—a pivotal example of how Diao came to blend New York school abstraction with identity politics in the nineties.\r\n\r\nDavid Herbert’s monumental sculpture The Phantom of Liberty comprises twelve-feet of scaffolding around the Statue of Liberty—except the Statue isn’t there. Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free… The memory of the message remains but its vessel is gone. The icon has been replaced with its void, its negative, its opposite. \r\n\r\nMatt Johnson’s meticulously carved wooden sculptures look like trash—literally. Untitled (Amazon Box) and Untitled (Avocado Box) are trompe-l’œil objects, where wood appears to crumple as easily as cardboard, and hand-painted surfaces transform expertly crafted objects into disused boxes.\r\n\r\nIn Eva and Franco Mattes’s No Fun, the artists staged Franco’s hanging to be broadcast on Chatroulette, an online chat and video website that was particularly popular when the work was made in 2010. The video contains both the constructed action and real reactions: Franco hangs on one side, with viewers responses to the scene on the other. Reality and fiction are dependent on one another. \r\n\r\nScale is one of the basic lies of photography (think: William Eggleston’s “monumental” tricycle), perhaps only second to cropping. In Jennifer and Kevin McCoy’s series of photos related to BROKER, a film about the insidious illusions of luxury merchandising, we find a smaller scale replica of the set. And in place of BROKER’s Gillian Chadsey, we find a smaller scale human, too. None of this is totally obvious, though, as scale shifts and becomes increasingly difficult to navigate with each image. \r\n\r\nWilliam Powhida’s Didactics is a series of sci-fi advertisements and news clippings that picture the art world of the future. Already crumpled, they appear discarded, locating the future-looking content in the present. Jeff Koons’s obituary and Art Basel Thieland (yes, you read that right) are two examples therein.\r\n\r\nKenya (Robinson)’s newest works are sex toys and sensual objects designed with prisoners in mind. Severe limitations in prisons serve to dehumanize inmates; having sex is a crime and access to anything beyond the already limited commissary is bleak. (Robinson)’s objects, made with bodega or 99-cent store goods like curlers, marbles, and latex gloves, envisage what inmates might design in this space, instilling prisoners with deserved humanity and urging the viewer to remember all the lives—and human needs—that occupy prisons.\r\n\r\nRachel Rossin brings the explosive denouement of Zabriskie Point point into contemporary focus. In Scrubbing 1, Maquette, VR enables a participant to enter a scene and become the narrative agent, setting off explosions or spinning these actions into reverse. Like Antonioni’s cathartic explosives that blast away every pristine and empty promise of consumerism, we find a similar impulse in Rossin’s work, located in our current moment. \r\n\r\nJoshua Citarella and Brad Troemel’s Ultra Violet Production House is an Etsy store that sells products that don’t exist—at least not until they are purchased. The products pictured are digital composites of products sourced from around the web, presenting a hypothetical view of what the work will look like after assembly. For alt-facts, UVph is releasing a new product that will be announced upon the opening of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2008, The Yes Men, along with a cadre of co-conspirators, handed out fake copies of the New York Times. Literally fake news, the front page headline read: IRAQ WAR ENDS. Dated July 9, 2009, the faux Times situated its wishful thinking in the future. A decade later, we still haven’t reached this future. It’s hard to say when we will. At least with a gesture like this, we can imagine and hope. \r\n \r\n "

          "Painted and printed lines transverse the inner universe of the gallery space, where a 7-foot painting and mixed media small works come off the wall.\r\n\r\nSolar-powered fans and lights unsettle and illuminate trails of tapestries. Celebratory brilliant yellows, greens, reds of life, of human existence, and of the natural world, at entrance, stretch arms into the gallery.  Visual and experiential, the exhibit speaks to earth for what it has become, and what it confronts at this time of climate change.\r\n\r\nFluid, transformational and sustainable, an interplay of colors that is Earth concerned…A heartbeat, the ripping of earth’s heart is at stake, a beating of the light and the air in this space, with red, orange, purple in lines that extend through space, and blue of life, river water, the ephemeral breath, blue, the seeing/non-seeing in society with our environmental care and non-care.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental degradation causes disconnection and breaks not only the ability to commune and community, but forces mass migration. These conditions bring a breakdown in the stability, cohesion, and sustainability of a community and ecosystems, and the inability to comprehend our own precarious survival.   - Columbia Fiero\r\n\r\n“Travel has been extremely critical and essential.  Voyages to Asia (Viet Nam, China, Korea, Hong Kong); to India; to South America (Ecuador—Amazonian, indigenous villages, as well as Galapagos); Czechoslovakia in 1990: the Velvet Revolution; extensively through Europe, and United States, had a strong effect —learning, seeing humanity and why we create: knowing oneself, as an American, as well as human being…how we are in relation to earth, and to each other.  How we differ and yet how we are capable of comprehending each other’s condition through feeling and intelligence: elements of depth of our capacity to know, relates to what is the earth and who are we to the earth. Social consciousness with the components of art, are able to intertwine in making art: utilizing installation, photography, painting, "

          "The Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art explores concepts of identity and queer archaeology through contemporary abstraction \r\n\r\nCurated by Avram Finkelstein \r\n \r\n\r\n“To be queer is to be an archaeologist. In order to find traces of ourselves in a world that prefers we be hidden, we excavate, sifting through our cultural landscape for ancestral signs, oftentimes as a matter of survival. FOUND is a survey of artists who treat queer identity like an archaeological dig, and in their quest for evidence of a queer footprint, they snap twigs along the trail, mapping their way in the process.” \r\n– Avram Finkelstein, Curator\r\n\r\nThe Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art presents FOUND: Queer Archaeology; Queer Abstraction curated by Avram Finkelstein, founding member of the Silence=Death and Gran Fury collectives. Coinciding with this exhibition, the Museum will debut the new QueerPower façade commission in early June 2017 designed by the Silence=Death Collective, and will honor this collective at their annual Summer Benefit on June 8 from 6 – 9 pm.\r\n\r\nFOUND surveys the work of 27 contemporary artists as well as ephemera from Greer Lankton. The work on view examines queer identity utilizing the tools of abstraction, and the exhibition design and installation take inspiration from the concept of the artist’s workshop as a space for excavation and inquiry. The exhibition begins with works depicting the inescapable stand-in for selfhood, the body, as reimagined by a group of artists intent on dismantling it. Here artists including Geoffrey Chadsey, Troy Michie, Rodrigo Moreira, Robert Lucy, and Frederick Weston survey notions of gender, race and class through depictions of human form. \r\n\r\nThe second grouping in this exhibition includes the work of Eve Fowler, LJ Roberts, Karen Heagle, Matt Lipps, and Angela Dufresne, which examines images of queerness within the canon of art history.\r\n\r\nThe third grouping of works in this exhibition presents works concerned with negative mark-making—incision, refusal, and erasure, all gestures of counter-inscription through the works of Ken Gonzales-Day, Carrie Yamaoka, Lucas Michael, Nancy Brooks Brody, and Anthony Goicolea. \r\n \r\nThe fourth grouping of works by artists Sam Gordon, Maika’i Tubbs, Alyse Ronayne, Brian Christopher Glaser, Jacob Robichaux, Doron Langberg, and Gaye Chan examine notions of detritus thorough the exploration of the generative potential of the things we discard, and hints at what is perhaps the queerest gesture of all, transformation. \r\n“Avram’s brilliant curatorial vision for this timely exhibition captures the zeitgeist of our times,” said Gonzalo Casals, Director of Leslie-Lohman. “As ideas of identities around the LGBTQ construct become more nuanced and intersectional, FOUND is a much needed survey on queerness that mirrors the need of LGBTQ contemporary artists to look back as they move forward.”\r\n \r\nThe final section of the exhibition suggests meta-visions of the ways personal and social identity can be layered, and sometimes placed in conflict through the works of Omar Mismar, Buzz Slutzky, Boris Torres, Maia Cruz Palileo, Pamela Sneed, and ephemera from Greer Lankton.\r\n \r\nThrough these five specific contemporary observations of queerness, FOUND uncovers queerness depicted through images of the alternatively sited body, opening the doors to a queer abstraction.\r\n \r\n“Avram’s brilliant curatorial vision for this timely exhibition captures the zeitgeist of our times,” said Gonzalo Casals, Director of Leslie-Lohman. “As ideas of identities around the LGBTQ construct become more nuanced and intersectional, FOUND is a much needed survey on queerness that mirrors the need of LGBTQ contemporary artists to look back as they move forward.” \r\n\r\nThis exhibition opens to the public on June 10 from 1 – 4 pm in conjunction with a block party hosting various food truck vendors, youth art fair from GSA MS 447 (Gender &amp; Sexualities Alliance at The Math &amp; Science Exploratory School), family activities, and music. Responding to the newly installed QUEERPOWER façade commission, Pamela Sneed, renowned poet, writer, and actress, will curate and host performances by Heather Johnson, the author of Survival Guide For Queer Black Youth; Carmelita Tropicana, who has been performing in New York’s downtown arts scene since the 1980s; and Ishmael Houston-Jones, one of contemporary dance’s most vital improvisers, collaborators, and contributors. \r\n\r\nQueerPower Façade Commission\r\n\r\nCoinciding with the opening of FOUND, Leslie-Lohman Museum will launch the new QueerPower façade commission in early June 2017. Each year, the Museum will commission an artist or group of artists to create work that will cover the façade of the Museum. \r\n\r\nTo inaugurate this initiative, the Museum will feature a site-specific installation by the Silence=Death Collective, adapting the iconic poster used by Act Up during the AIDS Pandemic in the 1980s calling attention to the lack of action by the United States government. The Collective will reorganize the iconic elements of the poster and contextualize the message with language that addresses the contemporary civil rights issues faced by the LGBTQ community. \r\n\r\n“Now more than ever, the powerful message behind the Silence=Death poster continues to inspire and empower us. We are honored to become a platform for the work of these artists/activists, and we are thrilled that the façade of our Museum will broadcast this powerful message to New York and beyond. \r\n#QueerPower,” said Casals. \r\n\r\nMembers of the Collective: Avram Finkelstein, Brian Howard, Charles Kreloff, Christopher Lione, Jorge Socarras, and Oliver Johnston (d. 1990).\r\n"

          "There are no good stories of air travel. Passengers, often paying high prices for heavily delayed, crowded flights, can expect to face indifferent ticketing agents, long security lines, and sometimes hostile airline policy, which might demand you give up your seat, even if you paid for it. The discomfort has been routinized into regular bits by mediocre comics. We accept it as the condition of getting somewhere we must or want to be. Airports themselves are cold, lonely spaces, where you are directed to either shop or get out, seemingly designed, in part, to heighten your anxiety, insisting that you must wait, but not for too long.\r\n\r\nIn these strange places, there is seldom access to an outside and most comforts are reserved for frequent fliers and the wealthy. Secluded within the airport, the luxury lounge is a kind of private garden of reclining chairs and martini glasses; its sliding glass doors open to reveal a glimpse of a warmly-inviting room administered by a friendly concierge, but, unless she flies often and pays the heavy fees of admission, the typical traveler is not permitted to enter.\r\n\r\nIn some airports, there are smoking rooms–glass cubes where employees of the airport and its restaurants as well as travelers can take a break and light up. In their way, they represent an architectural antithesis to the pay-per-use, priority lounges where the upper class decamp among couches and little beds, before or in between flights. They are typically transparent, as if the smokers were swimming in the cloudy waters of an aquarium, their habit placed on display for non-smokers, those without a cigarette, or anyone else for that matter who passes by. Should I bum one since I left my pack at home? Will it ease my nerves? How will I smell? Will it look strange for me to sit there, posed on a reeking pleather chair, facing a long runway of taxiing jets glinting in the sunlight?\r\n\r\nMaja Čule (Rijeka, Yugoslavia, b. 1984) is artist based in New York. In her video works, Čule constructs the scenarios from which the image is formed, encompassing both performance and image production. Čule participated in exhibitions at Lavra Gallery, Kiev; Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria; Galerija Nova, Zagreb; Goethe Institut Curatorial Residencies, New York; Andreas Huber Gallery, Vienna; Hessel Museum in New York and in Palazzo Peckham at the 55th Venice Biennale. She has had solo exhibitions at Arcadia Missa, London; Stadium Gallery, New York; CEO Gallery, Malmö; and has made performances at the Theatre &amp;TD, Zagreb; Bergen Kunsthall, Norway; Kunstraum Bethanien, Berlin.\r\n"

          "I find mushrooms incredible … their sole function is to lift their spores out of the ground to be carried away by the wind. So why do they have this immense variety of shapes, colors, and constituents, some of them psychoactive? As far as we know, they don’t communicate with other mushrooms above the ground, and they don’t use these toxins to protect themselves. There’s something else going on that we don’t understand. \r\n—Carsten Höller\r\n \r\nGagosian presents “Reason,” recent work by Carsten Höller, his first exhibition in New York since the New Museum survey in 2011.\r\n \r\nTowering mushroom collages, a maze of mirrored panels, abstract paintings, hyperreal little fishes, an environment for children in the form of a huge dice: Höller unites art, play, and phenomenology to transform the gallery into a laboratory of reason and the incomprehensible. With a professional formation in the natural sciences, Höller has long been fascinated by the unique attributes and behaviors of people, fungi, and animals. The Giant Triple Mushroom (2015) sculptures combine enlarged cross-sections of three different species, fungal hybrids that seem at once empirical and surreal. Fly agaric mushrooms always make up at least half of these sculptures; like many of Höller’s topics, they are both formally and conceptually captivating, incarnations of “irrationality with a method.” When ingested, they can induce hallucinogenic effects—as seen in Muscimol (1996), an early video of the artist under the influence. Flying Mushrooms (2015) is a giant stabile with moving parts, which turns when its lowest arm is pushed, causing a crop of seven fly agaric replicas to orbit slowly through the air, living up to their name. Each mushroom is cut vertically down the middle, then reassembled so that one half is upright and the other upended, the distinctive white-spotted red caps spinning like propellers at either end of their stems.\r\n\r\nHöller searches for reason only to escape or disprove it. He allows experience to surpass meaning, and provides a model for infinity through radical simplicity. While his Divisions paintings, animal works, and neon objects embody this model, Revolving Doors (2004/16) repeats the mirrored image endlessly, creating a mise-en-abîme that engulfs those who enter it in a multitude of ever-changing reflections.\r\n\r\nCarsten Höller was born in 1961 in Brussels, Belgium to German parents and lives in Stockholm, Sweden, and Biriwa, Ghana. Institutional exhibitions include the 50th Biennale di Venezia (2003); “Carsten Höller: One Day One Day,” Färgfabriken, Stockholm (2003); 7th Biennale de Lyon (2003); “Carsten Höller: Half Fiction,” Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2003); “Carsten Höller: 7,8 Hz,” Le Consortium, France (2004); “Carsten Höller: Une exposition à Marseille,” Musée d’Art Contemporain, Marseille (2004); 51st Biennale di Venezia (2005); “Carsten Höller: Test Site,” Tate Modern, London (2006); “Carsten Höller: Amusement Park,” MASS MoCA, North Adams, MA (2006); “Carsten Höller: Carrousel,” Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria (2008); “Carsten Höller: The Double Club,” Fondazione Prada, London (2008); 28th Bienal de São Paulo (2008); “Carsten Höller: Double Slide,” Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb, Croatia (2009); 53rd Biennale di Venezia (2009); 8th Gwangju Biennale (2010); “Carsten Höller: Divided Divided,” Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam (2010); “Carsten Höller: Soma,” Hamburger Bahnhof, Museum für Gegenwart, Berlin (2010); “Carsten Höller: Double Carousel with Zöllner Stripes,” MACRO- Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Roma, Italy (2011); “Carsten Höller: Experience,” New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York (2011); 11th Sharjah Biennale (2013); “Carsten Höller: LEBEN,” Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna (2014); 8th Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art (2014); 10th Gwangju Biennale (2014); “Carsten Höller: Golden Mirror Carousel,” National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (2014–15); 56th Biennale di Venezia (2015); “Carsten Höller: Decision,” Hayward Gallery, London (2015); and “Carsten Höller: Doubt,” Pirelli HangarBicocca, Milan (2016).\r\n\r\nHöller’s Slide at the ArcelorMittal Orbit, an addition to Anish Kapoor’s ArcelorMittal Orbit (2012) commissioned in 2016, is permanently installed at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London.

          "Welancora Gallery presents an exhibition of new works by Chanel Kennebrew. The exhibition is curated by Daricia Mia DeMarr.  This most recent body of work demonstrates Kennebrew’s expert ability to stylize and compose an image in order to tell a story and bring awareness to an issue.  \r\n\r\nThis series by Chanel Kennebrew is a cunning exploration of shattering, revealing, exposing, questioning and colliding for the sake of creation. The work seeks to investigate the realities and possibilities of technology, of modern communication and ideas of representation. #ElectricRainbowDaydreams is a collection of vibrant imagery composed and stylized by an artist in a constant state of making. Kennebrew is a multi-disciplinary, commercial, graphic design and fine artist. Each craft has a role in her work. The essence of this series is that of a socio-cultural, political meditation channeling the pensive and the carefree. It’s a creative exegesis of color, playful objects and the spirit of joy.\r\n\r\nThe technological surge of the 21st century has awarded us the means to share and communicate in ways only science fiction could have previously imagined. Kennebrew engages this phenomenon by superimposing electronic objects such as stereos, televisions and recorders with human body parts and figures. The bodies are carefree; in motion, leaping, dancing and jumping. With sharp wit, Kennebrew incorporates glops and splashes of paint in the steps of these figures to indicate the looming hazard our electronic tools impart on communication. She questions the impact of the sleek and well-advanced smartphone that bundles all past electronics into one. This new mode of communication and its applications, especially regarding social media has forever transformed human engagement. These devices and ‘apps’ have replaced or obstructed our view of each other and have also deteriorated and enmired actual connecting and understanding.\r\n\r\n#ElectricRainbowDaydream is a lesson and a celebration. The series invokes the passion of the artist but also aims to connect her questions and experiences to that of the viewer. It harbors joy and wonderment in concert with a subtle warning. It’s loud with color; it’s a remix, a throwback, but also a guide. It expresses fortitude and a genuine interest in the politics of freedom. This series reminds us to recall and retain the spirit of our authentic voice.  - Daricia Mia DeMarr"

          "Elizabeth Dee presents Betty Blayton, the first posthumous solo show of the legendary Harlem artist, activist and Studio Museum in Harlem co-founder. This non-profit exhibition is presented in conjunction with the launch of the new Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University, as part of Uptown, a triennial with multiple venues at uptown institutions and historic sites that will survey the work of artists who live and work north of 99th Street.  \r\n\r\n“The triennial, Uptown spotlights the widespread artistic activity across our communities, and so it is imperative to include Betty Blayton,” said Deborah Cullen, Director &amp; Chief Curator of the Wallach Art Gallery. “Her legacy—while remaining somewhat unsung—continues to be felt within and beyond the neighborhood, through her work in establishing arts organizations, innovative approaches to arts education, and unique contributions to the field of American abstract art.”\r\n \r\nThe exhibition will highlight a selected group of paintings, on view for the first time in Harlem, bringing Blayton’s work full circle, to the original home of the Studio Museum at 2033 Fifth Avenue, the current location of Elizabeth Dee. Betty Blayton arrived in New York City in the 1960s, at the time the Civil Rights, Black Power, and Women’s Liberation movements were emerging, and a critical moment in art, race, and gender politics. A lack of diversity and inclusiveness was evident in all sectors of the art world, and artists of color, with the formation of collectives and various movements, challenged the status quo and led by example, in particular with collaborative engagement uptown.\r\n \r\nBlayton’s art engaged in a dialogue with that of her contemporaries, including Romare Bearden, Charles White, Richard Hunt, and Barbara Chase-Riboud. Avoiding explicit depictions of the turbulent 1960s and 1970s, Blayton chose to represent an inner revolution framed by a search for spirituality, serenity, and wholeness. “The intent of my work is twofold,” she once stated, “personal growth on one hand, and the other, allowing the individual viewer opportunities to bring forth their subconscious thoughts and feelings.”\r\n \r\nThe exhibition’s curator Souleo adds, “As we look at the ‘60s and ‘70s, Blayton’s formative years, compared to where we are today, we see strong parallels with various issues related to race, politics, and gender. It is inspiring to trace her evolution and see how she navigated those challenges as both an activist and artist. She had one of the strongest voices when it came to relaying what it meant to be a fully engaged artist within society, where one’s impact is felt both on and off the canvas.”\r\n \r\nBetty Blayton was born on July 10, 1937, in Williamsburg, Virginia. She earned a BFA in painting and illustration from Syracuse University in 1959. Blayton was a founding member of the Studio Museum in Harlem and served on its board from 1965 to 1977. From 1968 to 1994 she was a consultant for the Board of Education of the City of New York, and instrumental in producing innovative arts education curricula.  In collaboration with Victor D’Amico (Director of the Department of Education at The Museum of Modern Art) and the Harlem School of the Arts, she established The Children’s Art Carnival (Harlem) and served as its executive director from 1969 to 1998. A young Jean-Michel Basquiat was one of the Carnival’s students. Blayton died on October 2, 2016, in the Bronx.  Blayton’s work will be included in Magnetic Fields: Expanding American Abstraction, 1960s to Today, at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Missouri, opening June 2017.\r\n \r\nSouleo is a Harlem-based independent curator and Manager of Public Programs at the Newark Museum. He has collaborated with many institutions, including the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Museum, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Stax Museum of American Soul Music, Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay &amp; Lesbian Art, African American Museum in Philadelphia, and the Houston Museum of African American Culture. He is a frequent contributor to The Huffington Post."

          "The Painting Center presents FIGHT OR FLIGHT curated by Alix Bailey, Barbara Marks and Patricia Spergel the Main Gallery and Project Room. \r\nThere’s no doubt in anyone’s mind that the November 2016 presidential election changed the political landscape forever and touched every U.S. resident in every corner of the country. For The Painting Center’s annual juried exhibition, FIGHT OR FLIGHT, we asked artists how the turbulent political environment has affected their work. Did they become more politically active by fighting—protesting, calling representatives, writing letters or did they retreat into their studios to shut out the frenetic world? Or did they adopt some combination of both approaches? \r\n\r\nLooking back to specific artists’ reactions to unsettled times, Picasso’s Guernica and Gerhard Richter’s cycle of paintings October 18,1977 are prime examples of artists channeling the political world into their work. While in contrast, Matisse created his joyful collaged paper cutouts for his Jazz series during World War II in France, and Jackson Pollock’s poured paintings were created in the 1950’s during the McCarthy era. Creativity can feed off the inspiration of current events or a personal vision.\r\n\r\nWe received an outpouring of interesting and timely work, and it is our hope that this selection provides some insight into the psyches of artists responding to the times in which we live in 2017. This exhibition is in no way a comprehensive representation but rather a curated selection of work both political and apolitical. We hope that it provides a starting point for an important conversation. \r\n\r\nArtists include: Carla Aurich, Heather Beardsley, Tinka Bechert, Samantha Beste, Sarah Bielski, Maria Bjorkdahl, Larissa Borteh, Susan Cantrick, Susan Carr, Alexander Churchill, Tom Climent, Lili Cohen Prah-Ya, Michele Colburn, Daniel Dallmann, Sarah D’Ambrosio, Carlo D’Anselmi, Mary DeVincentis, Patricia Fabricant, Gordon Fearey, Barbara Friedman, Elizabeth Gilfilen, Nancy Gladwell, Hilary Goldblatt, Suzy Gonzalez, Julie Graham, Alvin Griffin, Melinda Hackett, Elizabeth Ashton Hallett, Fukuko Harris, Paula Heisen, Jesse Hickman, Amy Hill, William Holton, April Zanne Johnson, Michelle Kaufman, Ruin Kenzie, Leslie Kerby, Keri Kimura, Liliya Krys-Burhoe, Jaena Kwon, Diana Lawrence, Chungha Lim, Sally Lord, Paul Manlove, China Marks, Olivia Leigh Martin, Alan Montgomery, Andrew Nash, Douglas Navarra, Ekaterina Popova, Ana Rankin, Elizabeth Reagh, Scott Reeds, Claudia Renfro, Lauren Schiller, Francis Sills, Candice Smith Corby, Jeff Starr, Jeanne Tremel, Kathy Weinberg, Ava Werner, Susan Wolsborn and Shihori Yamamoto.\r\n\r\n"

          "On the evening of the June 21st summer solstice, Ugo Rondinone: I ♥ John Giorno—the first major U.S. exhibition about the American poet, artist, activist and muse John Giorno—will open simultaneously across 13 locations in New York City. I ♥ John Giorno is a work of art by Giorno’s husband, the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. The exhibition is a celebration of the life and work of John Giorno—an artist whose work has influenced generations. Taking place in his chosen hometown, the exhibition affords a unique opportunity for Giorno’s contributions to be recognized within the canons of American poetry and art history, and celebrates the artist’s 80th birthday. \r\n\r\nI ♥ John Giorno is an unprecedented collaboration between leading non-profit and alternative spaces across New York, which are joining forces for the first time to mount a multilayered exhibition on a single subject. Partner venues include: Artists Space, High Line Art, Howl! Happening, Hunter College Art Galleries, The Kitchen, New Museum, Red Bull Arts New York, Rubin Museum of Art, Sky Art, Swiss Institute, White Columns, and 80WSE Gallery. Reconfigured as a festival, including installations in galleries and public spaces, as well as a full roster of public programs and events, I ♥ John Giorno is free and open to the public. \r\n\r\nExpanding upon the exhibition that took place at Palais de Tokyo in Paris from October 2015 to January 2016, I ♥ John Giorno has been re-conceptualized specifically for New York, highlighting Giorno’s significant relationship with the city, and his singular role in creating and fostering community here. The 18-part exhibition has been divided by Rondinone into chapters reflecting the layers of Giorno’s life and work, his longstanding influence on and dedication to his chosen hometown of New York City, and his relationships with artist friends, lovers and collaborators including: Richard Bosman, Phong Bui, Angela Bulloch, Anne Collier, Verne Dawson, Judith Eisler, John Giorno, Mark Handforth, Matthew Higgs, Pierre Huyghe, Françoise Janicot, Scott King, Elizabeth Peyton, Ugo Rondinone, Erik Satie, Kendall Shaw, Michael Stipe, Billy Sullivan, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Peter Ungerleider,  Joan Wallace, and Andy Warhol, whose work will be presented as part of the festival.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition format echoes the symbiotic relationship between Ugo Rondinone and John Giorno, who have been both partners and collaborators for the past two decades. Rondinone describes the show saying: “I ♥ John Giorno is a kaleidoscopic exhibition about the life and work of American poet and Tibetan Buddhist John Giorno, whose rich and stimulating life has woven many threads of American culture and spirituality. Within the dreamscape of the exhibition, one is invited to wander through the juxtaposed realm of art and poetry where image and language build upon themselves in a layered stream of consciousness driven by the biographical, the conceptual, and the emotional.”    \r\n\r\nI ♥ John Giorno is made possible in part by public funds from Pro Helvetia, Swiss Arts Council. The I ♥ John Giorno organizing committee gratefully acknowledges generous support from Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Thanks to Almine Rech Gallery, Brussels, London, New York and Paris; Elizabeth Dee Gallery, New York; Esther Schipper, Berlin; Galerie Eva Presenhuber, New York and Zürich; Gladstone Gallery, Brussels and New York; Galerie Kamel Mennour, London and Paris; Kukje Gallery, Seoul; and Sadie Coles, London for production support. Additional thanks to Ophelia and Bill Rudin as well as the General Consulate of Switzerland in New York for their gracious contribution, and to agnès b. for in kind support.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1936, Giorno is an artistic innovator who has been defying assumptions of poet, performer, political activist, Tibetan Buddhist, and visual artist since he emerged upon the New York art scene in the late 1950s. In the 1960’s, he began producing multi-media, multi-sensory events concurrent with Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable. He worked with Rauschenberg’s Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T) in 1966, and with Bob Moog in 1967-68. His breakthroughs in this area include Dial-A-Poem, which was first exhibited in 1968 at the Architectural Society of New York, and was exhibited in the MoMA’s Information exhibition in 1970. His contributions are significant to many culturally defining moments: the Beat generation, Pop Art, Punk, Pictures Generation, and the hip-hop era. His work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Musée National d´Art Moderne, Paris; and Queensland Art Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane; among others. \r\n\r\nUgo Rondinone (b. 1964, Brunnen, Switzerland) is a renowned mixed-media artist who lives andworks in New York. Recent solo shows include: vocabulary of solitude, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; I ❤ John Giorno, Palais de Tokyo, Paris; artists and poets, Secession, Vienna; breathe walk die, Rockbund Art Museum, Shanghai; we run through a desert on burning feet, all of us are flowing our faces look twisted at the Art Institute of Chicago; and seven magic mountains, Nevada, organized by Art Production Fund and the Nevada Museum of Art. His work is in the collections of MoMA, New York, the ICA, Coston, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and the Dallas Museum of Art, among others.\r\n\r\nJOHN GIORNO DANCING\r\nKendall Shaw\r\nBertha and Karl Leubsdorf Gallery\r\n\r\nThe Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Gallery displays works by Kendall Shaw depicting his close friend John Giorno. In 1963, Shaw took photos of Giorno dancing that later inspired his spare paintings whose black outlines and colorful silhouettes depict Giorno’s body in motion. The works were first exhibited at the Tibor de Nagy gallery in September 1964. For the first time, a number of Shaw’s original photographs will also be exhibited alongside the paintings.  \r\n\r\nGRASPING AT EMPTINESS\r\nRichard Bosman and John Giorno\r\nBertha and Karl Leubsdorf Gallery\r\n\r\nAlso on view at the Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Gallery is Grasping at Emptiness, a collaboration featuring Giorno’s 1978 eponymous poem and 20 drawings by Richard Bosman. Bosman’s dynamic depictions of frustration evoke Giorno’s poem about a fraught end to a relationship. This book was published in 1985 by the Kulchur Foundation, an independent press and granting organization that supported poets and critics now primarily known as part of the New York School. \r\n\r\nJOHN GIORNO AND TIBETAN BUDDHISM\r\nWith works by John Giorno and Ugo Rondinone\r\n205 Hudson Gallery\r\n\r\n“When you’re a Buddhist, you work with your mind in meditation, and with various practices you train the mind to realize its empty nature. Strangely, that’s the way I make poems! Maybe it’s developing the ability to see what arises in one’s mind, how it arises and its nature, that makes Buddhism very sympathetic to poets.” — John Giorno\r\n\r\nJohn Giorno was first introduced to Buddhism during his undergraduate studies at Columbia University in 1956 as part of its Core Curriculum.  After several trips to India during the 1970s, he discovered Tibetan Buddhism and became a disciple of Dudjom Rinpoche (1904–1987), master of the Nyingmapa lineage, which Giorno actively helped to promulgate in the United States. \r\n\r\nEvery New Year since 1986, Giorno has welcomed Buddhist masters and students to his home for the traditional fire ceremony, during which the obstacles of the previous year are released to usher in the new one. For this exhibition, Giorno’s personal shrine from his home, which is decorated with intricate brocade from the sacred pilgrimage site of Benaras in India, has been relocated to the gallery space.  Additionally, selected from the collection of the Rubin Museum of Art, a group of eighteen thangkas—Tibetan paintings—are also on display along with two from Giorno’s personal collection. \r\n\r\nPadmasambhava, the founding figure of the Nyingmapa order, is depicted in a number of the works. Considered to be a “Second Buddha” in Tibet, Padmasambhava played a predominant role in the advancement of Buddhism across Tibet in the 8th century. Padmasambhava is endowed with superhuman qualities and shown through Tibetan iconography in a variety of forms.\r\n\r\nGuru Pema Drakpo is one of the most wrathful depictions of Padmasambhava, an illustration of the powerful energy required to neutralize and transmute the obstacles that inevitably arise on the path to Enlightenment and spiritual accomplishment.  He holds in his hand a vajra or “Diamond Thunderbolt,” a symbol of Enlightenment and a ritual object.  Padmasambhava is believed to have been essential to the dissemination of the teachings of the Vajrakila, also known as the “Diamond Dagger,” throughout Tibet.\r\n\r\nConversely, Guru Pema Jungne is a more peaceful depiction of Padmasambhava. Known as the “Lotus-Born,” he is often shown sitting on a flower and dressed in the robes of a monk, teaching Dharma to the people.  In his right hand he holds a diamond scepter, while in his left he holds a skullcap of clear nectar.\r\n\r\nAIDS TREATMENT PROJECT\r\nWith works by John Giorno, Ugo Rondinone and Peter Ungerleider\r\n205 Hudson Gallery\r\n\r\n205 Hudson Gallery presents material from Giorno’s AIDS Treatment Project begun in 1984. Conceived as a direct-action program, Giorno described it as “my personal effort to combat with all-pervasive compassion, the catastrophe of the AIDS epidemic. Cash grants for emergency situations: back rent, telephone and utilities, food, nursing, alternative medicine not covered by Medicaid, taxis, whatever is needed. Money given with love and affection.”\r\n\r\nFacilitated through his non-profit foundation, Giorno Poetry Systems, many artists in his LP series, such as William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Patti Smith, among many others, donated their royalties to the AIDS Treatment Project. Giorno also organized benefit performances at the Beacon Theater with artists including Debbie Harry, Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson and Sonic Youth; posters from these concerts are included here. The AIDS Treatment Project concluded in 2004, though Giorno has continued to help poets and artists since with medical problems.\r\n\r\nPeter Ungerleider’s film Loving Kindness, presented with the AIDS Treatment Project documentation, is a portrait of Giorno that focuses on his work with the AIDS Treatment Project interspersed with his musings on death within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\r\n"

          "On the evening of the June 21st summer solstice, Ugo Rondinone: I ♥ John Giorno —the first major U.S. exhibition about the American poet, artist, activist and muse John Giorno—will open simultaneously across 13 locations in New York City. I ♥ John Giorno is a work of art by Giorno’s husband, the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. The exhibition is a celebration of the life and work of John Giorno—an artist whose work has influenced generations. Taking place in his chosen hometown, the exhibition affords a unique opportunity for Giorno’s contributions to be recognized within the canons of American poetry and art history, and celebrates the artist’s 80th birthday.\r\n\r\nI ♥ John Giorno is an unprecedented collaboration between leading non-profit and alternative spaces across New York, which are joining forces for the first time to mount a multilayered exhibition on a single subject. Partner venues include: Artists Space, High Line Art, Howl! Happening, Hunter College Art Galleries, The Kitchen, New Museum, Red Bull Arts New York, Rubin Museum of Art, Sky Art, Swiss Institute, White Columns, and 80WSE Gallery. Reconfigured as a festival, including installations in galleries and public spaces, as well as a full roster of public programs and events, I ♥ John Giorno is free and open to the public.\r\n\r\nExpanding upon the exhibition that took place at Palais de Tokyo in Paris from October 2015 to January 2016, I ♥ John Giorno has been re-conceptualized specifically for New York, highlighting Giorno’s significant relationship with the city, and his singular role in creating and fostering community here. The 18-part exhibition has been divided by Rondinone into chapters reflecting the layers of Giorno’s life and work, his longstanding influence on and dedication to his chosen hometown of New York City, and his relationships with artist friends, lovers and collaborators including: Richard Bosman, Phong Bui, Angela Bulloch, Anne Collier, Verne Dawson, Judith Eisler, John Giorno, Mark Handforth, Matthew Higgs, Pierre Huyghe, Françoise Janicot, Scott King, Elizabeth Peyton, Ugo Rondinone, Erik Satie, Kendall Shaw, Michael Stipe, Billy Sullivan, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Peter Ungerleider, Joan Wallace, and Andy Warhol, whose work will be presented as part of the festival. For more information about the other chapters visit the exhibition website: http://www.ilovejohngiorno.nyc/\r\n\r\nJoin us at The Kitchen to see works by Mark Handforth, Françoise Janicot, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and Joan Wallace. Tiravanija’s piece untitled 2008 (john giorno reads) is a scale model of a portion of Giorno’s Bowery loft. Inside viewers can sit on a bench by Handforth and watch Tiravanija’s video shot in Giorno’s home that features him reminiscing about his life and reading poetry. Nearby 88 photographs by Janicot document Giorno’s life and performances at poetry festivals around the world, while a sculptural portrait by Wallace references Andy Warhol’s 1963 depiction of Giorno in Sleep by featuring stills from the film silkscreened onto rotating plywood panels.\r\n\r\nABOUT JOHN GIORNO John Giorno (b. 1936, New York City, USA) is an artistic innovator who has been defying conventional definitions of poet, performer, political activist, Tibetan Buddhist, and visual artist since he emerged upon the New York art scene during the late 1950s. In the 1960s, he began producing multi-media, multi-sensory events concurrent with Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable. He worked with Rauschenberg’s Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T) in 1966, and with Bob Moog in 1967-68. His breakthroughs in this area include Dial-A-Poem, which was first presented in 1968 at the Architectural Society of New York, and was later included in the MoMA’s Information exhibition in 1970. His contributions are significant to many culturally defining moments: the Beat generation, Pop Art, Punk, the Pictures Generation, and the hip-hop era. His work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Musée National d´Art Moderne, Paris; and Queensland Art Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane; among others.\r\n\r\nABOUT UGO RONDINONE Ugo Rondinone (b. 1964, Brunnen, Switzerland) is a renowned mixed-media artist who lives and works in New York. Recent solo shows include: your age my age and the age of the rainbow, The Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow; let’s start this day again, Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati; every time the sun comes up, Place Vendome, Paris; girono d’oro + notti d’argento, Mercati die Traiano, Rome; becoming soil, Carre d’Art, Nîmes; seven magic mountains, Art Production Fund and Nevada Museum of Art/Desert of Nevada; vocabulary of solitude, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; I ♥ John Giorno, Palais de Tokyo, Paris; golden days and silver nights, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; and artists and poets, Secession, Vienna. His work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and the Dallas Museum of Art, among others. Upcoming shows include the world just makes me laugh at Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley; and good evening beautiful blue at Bass Museum of Art, Miami."

          "Andrew Edlin Gallery celebratesthe summer season with a selection of paintings by three artists presented for the first time in our gallery: Jillian Mayer, Dasha Shishkin, and Summer Wheat.\r\n\r\nJillian Mayer (b. 1986, Miami, FL) explores how technology impacts our identities and experiences. Her recent paintings animate figures absorbed by the digital screens of their devices, poised in idyllic fields of blue and green. Painted one-dimensionally, these works speak to our habitual distractions and the virtualization of nature. Her work is currently on view in Past Skin at MoMA PS1 in New York through September 10, 2017. Her solo exhibition, Slumpies, was held in 2016 at the Perez Art Museum in Miami. Mayer’s multimedia work has been presented in various institutions including the Bass Museum of Art (Miami), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Montreal, the Guggenheim Museum (New York) and film festivals like Sundance, SXSW, and the New York Film Festival.\r\n\r\nIn his review of her 2013 solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara, Charles Donelan wrote that Dasha Shiskin “combines virtuosic traditional contour drawing with a devilishly transgressive sensibility. Even as one admires the artist’s extraordinary facility with line, the aesthetic pleasure of these brightly colored, incident-filled scenes becomes complicated by the sense that their content consistently crosses over certain lines of everyday decorum.” The art of Dasha Shishkin (b. 1977, Moscow) was also the subject of a solo exhibition, I surrender, Dear, at the CAC Cincinnati in 2012. Her works are in the permanent collections of various institutions including the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Dallas Museum of Art and the Hamburger Kunsthalle (Hamburg).\r\n\r\nSummer Wheat’s (b. 1977, Oklahoma City) large-scale works recall the compositions of cave paintings but with textile-like surfaces. She presents feminized ecosystems, blending the present with the primordial, the human with the mythological. In 2016, she was awarded the Artadia Prize at NADA New York, and more recently, had a work purchased by the Dallas Museum of Art during the Dallas Art Fair’s acquisition program. Her current solo exhibition, “Full Circle,” is on view at the University of Washington’s Henry Art Galley (Seattle) through September 17, 2017. Her next solo exhibition will take place in September at the Braverman Gallery in Tel Aviv, Israel.\r\n"

          "Nathalie Karg Gallery presents No Paintings, Seth Cameron’s first exhibition with the gallery. The No paintings are square, symmetrical compositions of finely differentiated, spectrally exact complementary colors, arranged around a central square of neutral gray created by the complements’ mix and equivalent to the color of the overall painting field. Deploying the negational prescriptions of Ad Reinhardt (no color, no texture, no line, no value, etc.) in conjunction with Josef Alber’s principle of simultaneous contrast (whereby color assumes the complementary chroma of adjacent color), the No paintings manifest a recursive mise en abyme: paintings of nothing but themselves.  \r\n\r\nSeth Cameron (b. 1982, South Carolina) is a painter and educator based in New York. Recent exhibitions include The Romance of Facts at McClain Gallery in Houston, Suns at Susan Inglett Gallery in New York and Measure for Measure at Nina Johnson Gallery in Miami. Recent essays include Professional Problems. Amateur Solutions in the Brooklyn Rail and Nine Years in VWVW (Denver). Cameron is a frequent visiting artist and lecturer on painting, social practice and arts education across the United States and Europe and is an adjunct professor at The Cooper Union, teaching sculpture and aesthetic theory. He is a founder of The Bruce High Quality Foundation and director of BHQFU, the collaborative’s educational initiative, where he teaches creative writing and art history."

          "Luhring Augustine presents Caída libre (Free fall), an exhibition by Miguel Calderón, featuring a film and sculptural installation centered on the theme of falconry. This presentation in the gallery’s Bushwick location is organized in collaboration with kurimanzutto, Mexico City.\r\n \r\nFor Calderón, falconry presents a unique interdependence between man and animal, predicated on the falconer’s desire to connect with nature and the bird’s instinctual drive to hunt for survival. His interest towards the subject originates from his personal experience of having a hawk as a young boy. Struck by the years of discipline it takes in training one’s bird, he became fascinated with the obsessive, almost compulsory fixation one develops in maintaining this partnership.\r\n \r\nCalderón’s film illustrates this relationship through the story of Camaleón, a bouncer at a nightclub in Mexico City who takes his falcon out hunting every morning. The protagonist regards his bird with respect, lust, and admiration. He watches her hunt empathically, as if to relive his own pursuits and conquests. Violence pervades Camaleón’s life, both in the chaotic atmosphere of his daily occupation as well as his homicidal past. Such brutality, however, stands in direct opposition to his unwavering affection for his falcon, on which he depends as if it were a euphoric drug.\r\n \r\nThe risk of losing one’s bird during each hunt consumes the falconer with an incontrovertible fear. It is the material of Camaleón’s nightmares, mitigated only by the sight of his falcon settled safely on its perch. Calderón’s sculptural installation of abandoned falcon perches harps on this potentiality. Without their occupants, these objects take on a sculptural quality. Crafted and individualized, they are imbued with a sense of ritual and personal history; each functioning as an extension of the falconer. Though removed from their original contexts, the knowledge of their former status circles the audience back to the moment of disconnection between man and animal, to questions of their respective survival, and the memory of their final hunt together.\r\n \r\nMiguel Calderón (b. 1971) is known for constructing narratives around everyday situations that comprise the cultural landscape of his native Mexico City. His work covers a broad range of themes ranging from violence and corruption, to youth and family dynamics; all are portrayed with a hint of theatricality, the macabre, and the fantastical. He has been the recipient of the Cisneros-Fontanals Art Foundation Grant and Commissions Program (2013), The MacArthur Fellowship for Film and New Media (2000), and the Bancomer/Rockefeller Fellowship (1995). Important solo exhibitions include Miguel Calderón: Color Bleed, Rochester Art Center, Rochester; Miguel Calderón, Casa América, Madrid; Conversations with a Tropical Vulture, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco; Bestseller, Panorámica, Museo Tamayo, Mexico City; and Ridiculum Vitae, La Panadería, Mexico City.\r\n \r\n[Image: On floor: Miguel Calderón, Perchas (Perches), 2017, Set of 54 mixed media pieces of variable dimensions, Installation dimensions variable\r\nFilm: Miguel Calderón, Camaleón (Chameleon), 2017, Digital video, From an edition of 5 and 2 artist’s proofs, Duration: 26:30 minutes\r\nInstallation view Caída Libre at kurimanzutto, Mexico City, 2017, Photograph: Omar Luis Olguin]"

          "Chapter 6 in Ugo Rondinone: I ♥ John Giorno\r\n\r\nHowl! Happening presents Pierre Huyghe’s Sleeptalking (d’après Sleep, 1963 de Andy Warhol, accompagné de la voix de John Giorno) (1998), part of the citywide I ♥ John Giorno festival, opening simultaneously across 13 locations in New York City on June 21, 2017.\r\n\r\nMore than 30 years after Andy Warhol’s Sleep (1963), Pierre Huyghe made Sleeptalking (d’après Sleep), by filming John Giorno as he slept. The framing is the same, but the subject has aged. As part of a series of works about the notion of interpretation, Pierre Huyghe associates sleep as filmed by Warhol with the dreams and utopias of the 60s. Awoken from his long slumber, the sleeper now speaks and becomes an actor in a different reality, evoking the time he lived and its history.\r\n\r\nI ♥ John Giorno is a work of art by the poet’s husband, Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. The exhibition is a celebration of the life and work of John Giorno—an artist whose work has influenced generations. Taking place in New York City, his hometown, and the East Village in particular, where he has been an almost lifelong resident, the exhibition affords a unique opportunity for Giorno’s contributions to be recognized within the canons of American poetry and art history, while celebrating the artist’s 80th birthday.\r\n\r\nIn Huyghe’s video projection, the time-marked face imperceptibly changes and rejuvenates. This return to the original Sleep, revealed in the film by a slow fade-out, is accompanied by the poet’s voice. Giorno describes the context of the creation of the film Sleep and the influence of American counterculture on his work. The length of this biographical narrative matches the time taken by this inversion of the biological process from old to young man.\r\n\r\n“There’s a big difference between perceiving something, which happens automatically, and discovering things for yourself. One of the reasons why the early 1960s were so great was that everyone—including me, who happened to be there—discovered things for the first time.” (John Giorno)\r\n\r\nI ♥ John Giorno is an unprecedented collaboration between leading non-profit and alternative spaces across New York, joining forces for the first time to present a multilayered exhibition on a single subject. Partner venues include Artists Space, High Line Art, Howl! Happening, Hunter College Art Galleries, The Kitchen, New Museum, Red Bull Arts New York, Rubin Museum of Art, Sky Art, Swiss Institute, White Columns, and 80WSE Gallery. Reconfigured as a festival, including installations in galleries and public spaces, as well as a full roster of public programs and events, I ♥ John Giorno is free and open to the public. \r\n\r\nExpanding upon the exhibition that took place at Palais de Tokyo in Paris from October 2015 to January 2016, I ♥ John Giorno has been reconceptualized specifically for New York, highlighting Giorno’s significant relationship with the city and his singular role in creating and fostering community here. The 18-part exhibition has been divided by Rondinone into chapters reflecting the layers of Giorno’s life and work, his long-standing influence on and dedication to his chosen hometown of New York City, and his relationships with artist friends, lovers and collaborators including Richard Bosman, Phong Bui, Angela Bulloch, Anne Collier, Verne Dawson, Judith Eisler, Mark Handforth, Matthew Higgs, Pierre Huyghe, Françoise Janicot, Scott King, Elizabeth Peyton, Ugo Rondinone, Erik Satie, Kendall Shaw, Michael Stipe, Billy Sullivan, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Peter Ungerleider, Joan Wallace, and Andy Warhol, whose work will be presented as part of the festival.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition format echoes the symbiotic relationship between Ugo Rondinone and John Giorno, who have been partners and collaborators for the past two decades. Rondinone describes the show saying: “I ♥ John Giorno is a kaleidoscopic exhibition about the life and work of American poet and Tibetan Buddhist John Giorno, whose rich and stimulating life has woven many threads of American culture and spirituality. Within the dreamscape of the exhibition, one is invited to wander through the juxtaposed realm of art and poetry where image and language build upon themselves in a layered stream of consciousness driven by the biographical, the conceptual, and the emotional.”    \r\n\r\nI ♥ John Giorno is made possible in part by public funds from Swiss Arts Council Pro Helvetia. The event’s organizing committee gratefully acknowledges generous support from Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Thanks to Almine Rech Gallery, Brussels, London, New York and Paris; Elizabeth Dee Gallery, New York; Esther Schipper, Berlin; Galerie Eva Presenhuber, New York and Zürich; Gladstone Gallery, Brussels and New York; Galerie Kamel Mennour, London and Paris; Kukje Gallery, Seoul; and Sadie Coles, London, for production support. Additional thanks to Ophelia and Bill Rudin as well as the Consulate General of Switzerland in New York for their gracious contribution, and to agnès b. for kind support.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1936, Giorno is an artistic innovator who has been blurring the lines of poet, performer, political activist, Tibetan Buddhist, and visual artist since he emerged upon the New York art scene in the late 50s. He began producing multimedia, multisensory events concurrent with Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable in the 60s. He worked with Rauschenberg’s Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T) in 1966, and with Bob Moog in 1967-68. His breakthroughs in this area include Dial-A-Poem, first exhibited in 1968 at The Architectural League of New York, and at MoMA’s Information exhibition in 1970. Giorno’s contributions are significant to many culturally defining moments: the Beat Generation, Pop Art, punk, The Pictures Generation, and the hip-hop era. His work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Musée National d´Art Moderne, Paris; and Queensland Art Gallery &amp; Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane; among others. \r\n\r\nUgo Rondinone (b. 1964, Brunnen, Switzerland) is a renowned mixed media artist who lives and works in New York. Recent solo shows include: vocabulary of solitude, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; I ♥ John Giorno, Palais de Tokyo, Paris; artists and poets, Secession, Vienna; breathe walk die, Rockbund Art Museum, Shanghai; we run through a desert on burning feet, all of us are flowing our faces look twisted at the Art Institute of Chicago; and seven magic mountains, an installation in Las Vegas, Nevada, organized by Art Production Fund and the Nevada Museum of Art. His work is in the collections of MoMA New York, ICA Boston, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the Dallas Museum of Art, among others.\r\n\r\n[Installation View of Sleeptalking (1998) by Pierre Huyghe at Palais de Tokyo, 2015, © Pierre Huyghe, Courtesy of Palais de Tokyo, Photo: Andre Morin.]"

          "The Arctic Melt, an exhibition of the recent photographic work of Diane Tuft. The exhibition will be Diane Tuft’s third solo exhibition at Marlborough Gallery.\r\n\r\nTuft’s photographs capture, in ways that are as startling as they are captivating, the deleterious effects of global warming on the northernmost parts of the planet. She strives to present the earth’s mysteries which lie beyond the readily visible. The artist’s desire to photograph our changing planet took her on an epic trek around the Arctic that included stops in Norway, the North Pole, and Greenland, with each destination providing compelling confrontations with rapidly shifting landscapes and seascapes. Mountainous but retreating glaciers, sparse blocks of ice floating in the sea, and dwindling numbers of once plentiful polar bears are among the tableaux Tuft encountered and expertly immortalized. Her photographic work is both artistic and factual, scientifically documenting parts of the world which most human beings, for a variety of reasons including isolation, apathy and mistreatment of Mother Nature, will never actually see.\r\n\r\nTuft has said of her artistic journey:\r\nThe Arctic is melting faster than any other place in the world. I felt compelled to photograph its splendor before the effects of global warming cause this landscape to disappear. In order to get a comprehensive picture of the fragility of the Arctic, I traveled to the mountain glaciers of Svalbard, Norway, the Arctic Ocean’s sea ice, and the icebergs and ice sheet of Greenland.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new photographic work, a four-and-a-half minute video installation, entitled The Arctic Melt, will be shown in the gallery.\r\nDiane Tuft is a mixed-media artist who has focused primarily on photography since 1998. She earned a degree in mathematics at the University of Connecticut before continuing her studies in art at the Pratt Institute, New York. Tuft has had solo exhibitions at Kimball Art Center, Park City, UT; Bruce Museum, Greenwich, CT; and Southampton Arts Center, Southampton, NY. Her work is included in the permanent collection of Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; International Center of Photography, New York, NY; Parrish Art Museum, Water Mill, NY; as well as numerous private collections. The artist lives and works in New York City.\r\n"

          "RUBBER FACTORY presents a solo exhibition of new works by Kate Stone from her “As It Was” series.\r\n\r\nYou’re not remembering it as it was. You’re pretty sure the rooms were bigger. And the ceilings were lower. There was red carpet. Or were the walls red? No, no it was definitely the carpet. But maybe it was more burgundy. And there were so many windows and a strange buzz from the air conditioner. At least that’s how you remember it. But you’ll never know for sure. The place is different now. You can never go back because it will never be the same and it will only disappoint you. So all you have is your memory and maybe a few snapshots but they don’t do it justice because a place is more than its image. It’s more than walls and floors. It’s a collage. It’s the way the floorboards creak, the way it smells in summer, the way your muscles remember the layout of every room. Photographs don’t capture that. They’re too static. They’re frozen in time and don’t smell like anything. But you hold on to those snapshots anyway because memory is unreliable. Every time you remember something you have to reconstruct it piece by piece and inevitably there are parts missing so you fill in the gaps - you exaggerate, embellish and invent. Sometimes you get close to the real thing but it’s never exact and it’s never the same twice. Memory is fluid. It expands and contracts, explodes and collapses. But in the end maybe your exaggerations, embellishments and inventions are more interesting than the real thing so you grasp on to those instead and repeat them over and over until they become “true,” all the while telling yourself that the truth is relative anyway so what’s the difference?\r\n\r\nAs It Was (as it were) is a mixed media installation that uses photography, drawing and construction materials to dissect the psychological space of memory - specifically the memory of  home. It blends the familiar with the unfamiliar to challenge associations we have with common architectural structures. The installation celebrates memory’s inaccuracies, its narrative gaps and the way we put the pieces together.\r\n\r\nKate Stone is a Brooklyn-based interdisciplinary artist. She received a BA in Photography from Bard College and an MFA from Parsons the New School for Design. She was a recipient of the Tierney Fellowship in 2009 and has exhibited at The Center for Photography at Woodstock, Eleni Koroneou Gallery, bitforms gallery, FiveMyles, Cuchifritos Gallery + Project Space, among others. \r\n"

          "JOHN GIORNO AND TIBETAN BUDDHISM\r\nWith works by John Giorno and Ugo Rondinone\r\n\r\n“When you’re a Buddhist, you work with your mind in meditation, and with various practices you train the mind to realize its empty nature. Strangely, that’s the way I make poems! Maybe it’s developing the ability to see what arises in one’s mind, how it arises and its nature, that makes Buddhism very sympathetic to poets.” — John Giorno\r\n\r\nJohn Giorno was first introduced to Buddhism during his undergraduate studies at Columbia University in 1956 as part of its Core Curriculum. After several trips to India during the 1970s, he discovered Tibetan Buddhism and became a disciple of Dudjom Rinpoche (1904–1987), master of the Nyingmapa lineage, which Giorno actively helped to promulgate in the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery New Year since 1986 Giorno has welcomed Buddhist masters and students to his home for the traditional fire ceremony, during which the obstacles of the previous year are released to usher in the new one. For this exhibition, Giorno’s personal shrine from his home, which is decorated with intricate brocade from the sacred pilgrimage site of Benaras in India, has been relocated to the gallery space. Additionally, selected from the collection of the Rubin Museum of Art, a group of eighteen thangkas—Tibetan paintings—are also on display along with two from Giorno’s personal collection.\r\n\r\nPadmasambhava, the founding figure of the Nyingmapa order, is depicted in a number of the works. Considered to be a “Second Buddha” in Tibet, Padmasambhava played a predominant role in the advancement of Buddhism across Tibet in the 8th century. Padmasambhava is endowed with superhuman qualities and shown through Tibetan iconography in a variety of forms.\r\n\r\nGuru Pema Drakpo is one of the most wrathful depictions of Padmasambhava, an illustration of the powerful energy required to neutralize and transmute the obstacles that inevitably arise on the path to Enlightenment and spiritual accomplishment. He holds in his hand a vajra or “Diamond Thunderbolt,” a symbol of Enlightenment and a ritual object. Padmasambhava is believed to have been essential to the dissemination of the teachings of the Vajrakila, also known as the “Diamond Dagger,” throughout Tibet.\r\n\r\nConversely, Guru Pema Jungne is a more peaceful depiction of Padmasambhava. Known as the “Lotus-Born,” he is often shown sitting on a flower and dressed in the robes of a monk, teaching Dharma to the people. In his right hand he holds a diamond scepter, while in his left he holds a skullcap of clear nectar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIDS TREATMENT PROJECT\r\nWith works by John Giorno, Ugo Rondinone and Peter Ungerleider\r\n\r\n205 Hudson Gallery presents material from Giorno’s AIDS Treatment Project begun in 1984. Conceived as a direct-action program, Giorno described it as “my personal effort to combat with all-pervasive compassion, the catastrophe of the AIDS epidemic. Cash grants for emergency situations: back rent, telephone and utilities, food, nursing, alternative medicine not covered by Medicaid, taxis, whatever is needed. Money given with love and affection.”\r\n\r\nFacilitated through his non-profit foundation Giorno Poetry Systems, many artists in his LP series, such as William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Patti Smith, among many others, donated their royalties to the AIDS Treatment Project. Giorno also organized benefit performances at the Beacon Theater with artists including Debbie Harry, Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson and Sonic Youth; and posters from these concerts are included here. The AIDS Treatment Project concluded in 2004, though Giorno has continued to help poets and artists since with medical problems.\r\n\r\nPeter Ungerleider’s film Loving Kindness, presented with the AIDS Treatment Project documentation, is a portrait of Giorno that focuses on his work with the AIDS Treatment Project interspersed with his musings on death within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\r\n"

Partner venues include: Artists Space, High Line Art, Howl! Happening, Hunter College Art Galleries, The Kitchen, New Museum, Red Bull Arts New York, Rubin Museum of Art, Sky Art, Swiss Institute, White Columns, and 80WSE Gallery. Reconfigured as a festival, including installations in galleries and public spaces, as well as a full roster of public programs and events, I ♥ John Giorno is free and open to the public.\r\n\r\nExpanding upon the exhibition that took place at Palais de Tokyo in Paris from October 2015 to January 2016, I ♥ John Giorno has been re-conceptualized specifically for New York, highlighting Giorno’s significant relationship with the city, and his singular role in creating and fostering community here. The 18-part exhibition has been divided by Rondinone into chapters reflecting the layers of Giorno’s life and work, his longstanding influence on and dedication to his chosen hometown of New York City, and his relationships with artist friends, lovers and collaborators including: Richard Bosman, Phong Bui, Angela Bulloch, Anne Collier, Verne Dawson, Judith Eisler, John Giorno, Mark Handforth, Matthew Higgs, Pierre Huyghe, Françoise Janicot, Scott King, Elizabeth Peyton, Ugo Rondinone, Erik Satie, Kendall Shaw, Michael Stipe, Billy Sullivan, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Peter Ungerleider, Joan Wallace, and Andy Warhol, whose work will be presented as part of the festival.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition format echoes the symbiotic relationship between Ugo Rondinone and John Giorno, who have been both partners and collaborators for the past two decades. Rondinone describes the show saying: “I ♥ John Giorno is a kaleidoscopic exhibition about the life and work of American poet and Tibetan Buddhist John Giorno, whose rich and stimulating life has woven many threads of American culture and spirituality. Within the dreamscape of the exhibition, one is invited to wander through the juxtaposed realm of art and poetry where image and language build upon themselves in a layered stream of consciousness driven by the biographical, the conceptual, and the emotional.” "

          "Eva Presenhuber presents STRAY, the gallery’s first solo exhibition with Los Angeles–based artist Shannon Ebner. This exhibition of new photographs includes FRIENDS IN DEED HOUSE, STRAY, SIGNAL ESCAPES, TEMPLE HIGH AND LO, PHOTORAMA, and others.\r\n\r\nThe title work STRAY includes an LP featuring poets Susan Howe and Nathaniel Mackey reading selections from their work. Two photographs of posters are displayed to the left and right of a turntable. For these images, Ebner selected a single verse from each poet. Here are photographs, a public space, recordings of two poets, a turntable and speakers—a work in a gallery.\r\n\r\nFor the occasion of the exhibition, Ebner has created a poster replete with a brief statement and excerpts from a constellation of literary and critical texts.\r\n\r\nEbner’s work has been exhibited widely in the United States and Europe, and is included in the public collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the Bard Hessel Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Ebner’s work has also been included in group exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Tate Modern, London; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Moscow Museum of Modern Art; Presentation House, Vancouver; and Künstlerhaus Austria. Ebner’s work was  shown at the 31st Biennial of Graphic Arts, Ljubljana (2015); the 54th Venice Biennale (2011); the 6th Berlin Biennale of Contemporary Art (2010); and the Whitney Biennial, New York (2008). Additionally, Ebner has presented solo exhibitions at Altman Siegel, San Francisco (2014, 2010); kaufmann repetto, Milan (2014, 2010); Sadie Coles HQ, London (2013); and Wallspace, New York (2013, 2009, 2007, 2005).

          "Ugo Rondinone: I ♥︎ John Giorno is a sprawling, multi-part exhibition that presents the extraordinary life and work of the poet, artist, activist and muse, John Giorno. Encompassing thirteen venues around Manhattan and featuring paintings, films, sound installations, drawings, archival presentations and a video environment, this retrospective includes work both by Giorno himself, as well as work that he has inspired.\r\n\r\nI ♥︎ John Giorno is also a work of art by Giorno’s husband, the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone, who has been creating sculptures, paintings, drawings and multi-media installations for almost three decades. With this project, Rondinone presents a prismatic portrait assembled from thoughtful arrangements of the materials, experiences and relationships that have defined Giorno’s astonishingly wide-ranging artistic career. Foremost, though, the project is a joyous celebration of Giorno’s ubiquitous presence in contemporary culture, as well as his myriad contributions to it.\r\n\r\nRondinone’s homage to his life partner, Ugo Rondinone: I ♥︎ John Giorno, is the latest, and by far, the most ambitious collaboration of Giorno’s career. The project unfolds in eighteen chapters, each a distinct exhibition sited in a non-profit or alternative space in Manhattan. Every chapter takes the form of an immersive installation designed by Rondinone and dedicated to a body of work, an interest, a relationship or a collaboration that has marked Giorno’s life. This includes his poetry, painting, sound work and performance; his recording projects, and his founding of Giorno Poetry Systems; his AIDS activism; his Tibetan Buddhism and his vast personal archive that comprises a history of radical art and poetry in New York during the second half of the twentieth century. Several installations feature portraits of Giorno by different generations of filmmakers, painters, videographers and musicians. One consists of a single work; a multi-channel video installation by Rondinone consisting of multiple images of Giorno performing one of his recent epic poems.\r\n\r\nUgo Rondinone: I ♥︎ John Giorno is a unique artistic and curatorial experiment. The cooperation between so many disparate nonprofit and alternative institutions in New York in the presentation of a single project is similarly unprecedented. The singularity of this monumental hybrid of artwork and exhibition is testament to the breadth, variation, and longevity of Giorno’s ongoing career, as well as Rondinone’s artistic vision. Those lucky or stalwart enough to visit all eighteen chapters of the exhibition will come away with an idea of both of these artists’ achievements. In its size and ambition, I ♥︎ John Giorno can be seen as a citywide work of public art. At the same time, it is an intimate expression of love and inspiration between two artist partners. It is an astonishing gesture of love on Giorno’s part to give the sum total of his life’s work to Rondinone as material for his own artwork. Perhaps it is equal only to Rondinone’s conception of an artwork as big as Manhattan to do justice to that gift. – Laura Hoptman\r\n\r\nAUDIO AND VISUAL WORKS OF JOHN GIORNO\r\nWith works by John Giorno and Ugo Rondinone\r\n\r\nRed Bull Arts New York presents a selection of John Giorno’s audio works amidst a dense display of visual pieces generated from his poems, reflecting the repetitive and layered nature of Giorno’s poetry itself.\r\n\r\nOffering random access to poems, Giorno’s visionary work Dial-A-Poem anticipated mass-media communication and the commercial success of telephone hotlines. As he saw it, reading a book in your armchair was a hundred years out of date and the traditional voice-only poetry reading was “so boring,” according to his friend Andy Warhol. For Dial-A-Poem, Giorno asked 250 artists to record their voices, mingling the poetry of John Ashbery, the energy of Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, the minimalist music of Philip Glass and instructions for making a Molotov cocktail in a poem by Diane di Prima. It was not poetry as a literary genre that interested Giorno, but rather the presence of the voice as sound; a noise or a message recorded and then communicated intimately via the telephone. After an initial tryout organized by the Architectural League in New York in 1968, Dial-A-Poem became a sensation, jamming the telephone lines during the Information exhibition at MoMA in 1970. “The majority of the calls,” Giorno remembers, “came between nine in the morning and five in the afternoon, which means in New York people imprisoned in their glass office buildings, sitting behind desks nervously dialing.” The Dial-A-Poem phone line, which has been reprised for this exhibition, can be reached by calling (641)793-8122.\r\n\r\nFor the Paris iteration of Ugo Rondinone: I ♥︎ John Giorno, Rondinone incorporated the text of Giorno’s poems on scrolling video screens which simultaneously play the audio of Giorno’s performance of the poem. These works are featured at Red Bull Arts New York amidst drawings and paintings by Giorno, all made in collaboration with his longtime designer Mark Michaelson. Between 1965 and 2004, Giorno worked with sound engineer Bob Bielecki to create 14 sound poems. Bielecki is known for his innovative use of technology, and together he and Giorno pioneered experimental audio work. All 14 sound poems can be heard on earphones attached to monitors suspended from the ceiling of the gallery that simultaneously show the text of the sound poems.\r\n\r\nIn the lower gallery nine songs recorded by The John Giorno Band are available for listening through headphones, along with photos taken by Kate Simon of The John Giorno Band performing at CBGB. Active from 1982-89, the original band included percussionist David van Tieghem, guitarist Pat Irwin and bassist Philippe Hagen. Giorno then went on to work with other artists including Lenny Kaye, Charlie and Adam Roth, Mike Osborne and David Conrad among others. Throughout the band’s existence, Giorno used his poems to create musical compositions and performances, chanting the works to highlight their repetitive, lyric quality. The John Giorno Band never released an album during its existence, but, in association with the festival, Red Bull Arts New York has produced an LP with the group’s nine songs. The lecture hall at Red Bull Arts New York features a single channel, looped installation of Ugo Rondinone’s recording of John Gi"

          "80WSE gallery presents A Gentle Man, inspired by a short story by Bernard Malamud.\r\n\r\nA Gentle Man, an exhibition by Becky Beasley, will be on view at NYU’s 80 Washington Square East Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe great problem of the short story, as Bernard Malamud puts it, is “to say everything that must be said and to say it quickly, fleetingly, as though two people had met for a moment in a restaurant, or a railroad station, and one had time only to tell the other they are both human, and, here, this story proves it.”[1]\r\n\r\nIn a time where ceaseless brevity of encounter and communication is a way of life, the short story feels more vital than ever and the short form is at the heart of this exhibition. A Gentle Man is a video installation with a linoleum floor and decor which transforms the length of the gallery’s five rooms into a journey, from day to night.\r\n\r\nThis newly commissioned four-part video portrait of an imaginary man from birth to the present (1940–2017) explores brevity and intensity through its four discreet chapters: The First Story; Me for You; In the Rain/MAMA; A Man Walking Up Broadway. The work presents a series of brief encounters, offering them as minor transgressions (of engagement, responsibility, cliché, profound love) and proposes their transformative potential as choices. Each chapter is located, along a floor design which traces Broadway; symbolically, at differing times of day – Morning, Afternoon, Evening and Night– and, emotionally, in an unspecified interior or exterior. In the exterior scenes it is always raining. The floor design briefly maps the space of Bernard Malamud’s early writing, and the short story, Spring Rain (1942), which is set around Morningside Heights. Malamud’s free education – from Flatbush to Harlem – is also mapped.British actor, Russell Tovey (Looking (HBO), Quantico (ABC), Angels in America (Royal National Theatre, London)) narrates.\r\n\r\nSpring Rain – written by the Brooklyn-born Malamud when he was 28 – was not published until 1989, three years after his death, and has received relatively little attention. Malamud’s biographer Philip Davis has confirmed this. Beasley has been fascinated by the story for a decade and at 80WSE she has taken the opportunity to chase the story in Manhattan itself. Malamud’s short story is a tender picture of interiority and a glimpse into a man’s experience of himself and responses to others. It is also about present-ness and time; a life and an evening flash into clarity for a moment as a result of watching a young man die at the beginning of the story and, later, whilst walking in the rain with his daughter’s boyfriend.\r\n\r\nUsing only existing light, the exhibition moves from day-lit front rooms on Washington Square to unlit rear spaces, illuminated here by large video projections. Kissing chairs designed as sculpture by the artist are presented in each of the rooms of the exhibition for visitors to sit on.\r\nCartographer Molly Roy’s beautiful map, Oscillating City – which charts population density in Manhattan by day and by night – from Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas (UC Press) by Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro will be exhibited in the foyer at 80WSE gallery as a prelude.\r\n[1] Conversations with Malamud, Edited by Lawrence Lasher, p12\r\n\r\nBecky Beasley lives and works in St. Leonards-on-Sea in the United Kingdom. She has had solo exhibitions at Towner Gallery (2017), Tate Britain (2012), Spike Island (2012), Leeds City Gallery (2013), Stanley Picker Gallery (2011), and produced solo live projects at Serpentine Pavilion (2010) and South London Gallery (2014). She was shortlisted for the Max Mara Prize in 2009, and the Contemporary Art Society Annual Museum Award in 2014. Her work has been included the major group exhibitions including Flatland: Narrative Abstractions, France and Luxembourg (2016-17); A Change of Heart, Hannah Hoffman Gallery, Los Angeles (2016); Over You, You: 31st Biennial of Graphic Arts, Slovenia (2015);Think Twice,Whitechapel Gallery, London (2012); The Imaginary Museum, Kunstverein Munich, Germany (2012); La Carte D’Après Nature, curated by Thomas Demand, NMNM, Monaco (2010). She graduated with an MFA from the Royal College of Art in 2002. She is represented by Laura Bartlett Gallery, London and Francesca Minini, Milan.\r\n\r\nA Gentle Man is Beasley’s first institutional exhibition in the United States."

          "Friedman Benda presents Wendell Castle, one of America’s most influential and iconic living designers, in his 5th solo exhibition at the gallery.\r\n \r\nEmbracing Upheaval is a fearless exploration, encompassing two groups: Block and Freeform.  Each can be seen alone or as elements of a larger story, both familiar and a departure.  Lyrical and unexpected, the new series continue Castle’s life-long interest in pushing the boundaries of furniture making, and represent Castle’s latest formal exploration into the convergence of sculpture and design.\r\n \r\nFreeform series, inspired and informed by the music that has accompanied Wendell throughout his career, recall an abstract line drawn in space. The connection is evident in titles referencing cities known for music, including, The Big Easy, Motown and KCMO.\r\n \r\nWith the Block Series, chairs and tables emanate from solid slab-like constructions, forms born of wood, Castle’s predominant material throughout his career. With these, Castle suggests metamorphosis with an allusion to classical literature and sculpture.  \r\n \r\nThe Memorial Art Gallery, Rochester, will host a second enlarged iteration of the Museum of Art + Design’s 2015/16 exhibition, Wendell Castle: Remastered, opening October 17 -December 31, 2017.  This exhibition will include the addition of new vintage and contemporary works, in particular the early seminal work Walnut Sculpture, 1958-59, and the organically formed tri-surface Twist Table from 1972. In June 2018, The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri and the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, Overland Park, Kansas, Castle’s home state, will present concurrent solo exhibitions.\r\n \r\nAbout the Artist\r\nIn a career spanning more than 6 decades, with a long record of acclaim, steady acquisitions, and continuous exhibitions by public institutions, Castle’s work is of indelible historic importance. He is an artist-maker who continuously mines his imagination and hones new skills, to create innovative vocabularies and forms.\r\n \r\nBorn in Kansas in 1932, Wendell Castle received a B.F.A. from the University of Kansas in Industrial Design in 1958 and an M.F.A. in sculpture, graduating in 1961. He moved to Rochester, New York to teach at the School of American Craftsmen and established a permanent studio in the area, which is where he still works today.  \r\n \r\nWendell Castle’s work can be found in the permanent collections of more than 50 museums and cultural institutions worldwide, including: Art Institute of Chicago, (IL); Los Angeles County Museum of Art, (CA); the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, NY); Museum of Modern Art (New York, NY); Minneapolis Institute of Arts, (MN); Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal (Quebec, Canada); Museum of Arts and Design (New York, NY); Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, (MA); Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (TX); Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, (KS); Philadelphia Museum of Art (PA); Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; (Washington, DC); the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London.  \r\n \r\nCastle has been the recipient of many honors and awards, including four National Endowment for the Arts grants, four honorary degrees, a Visionaries of the American Craft Movement Award from the American Craft Museum (1994), the American Craft Council Gold Medal (1997), Master of the Medium Award from The James Renwick Alliance of National Museum of American Art, (1999), and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Brooklyn Museum of Art (2007)."

          "Chambers Fine Art presents Transitions, an exhibition featuring three young artists whose works illustrate the way in which transitional periods within their lives have informed their art practice. The gallery will present the work of Dong Yuan, Lam Tung-pang and Lao Tongli, with each artist submitting works that correspond with significant changes in their personal and professional lives.\r\n\r\nFor Dong Yuan, the accelerated pace of change in contemporary China causes her to retreat from time to into periods of self-reflection. The last year for example has marked an artistic departure from her previous oil paintings of household objects, and she has instead been creating works that are spiritually connected with the automatic paintings of the surrealists, painting ‘whatever comes into my mind, in a subconscious manner’. The resulting compositions are devoid of space and filled with a sea of overlapping shapes and colors. Upon closer inspection, it is in fact creatures and characters of all kinds that populate her canvases, some in human form, others resembling animals or monsters, and all of them with cartoonish sets of eyes staring every which way. Although her paintings are small in scale, their abundance of detail sets up an immersive experience. In one of her less ‘subconscious’ compositions, Dong Yuan’s creatures coalesce into an image of Chairman Mao on the 100 renminbi note. The painting is meant as a critique on an ‘ugly by-product’ of China’s fast-paced modernization, the writhing mass of creatures representing the greed-obsessed, ‘awful side of human nature’.\r\n\r\nLam Tungpang employs similar currency-related imagery in his recent works. Two Hong Kong currency notes, printed onto Xuan paper and then mounted on canvas, have been methodically ‘erased’, leaving the faded images of a 10 HK dollar note from the British colonial era and a contemporary 100 HK dollar note issued by the Bank of China. In a 2012 article in the Yishu Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art, Lam mused that ‘Administratively, much of Hong Kong has returned to the way it was mandated by China, but its culture and lifestyle won’t return for at least fifty years… We are exactly in the moment of the shift… After one hundred years, there may no longer be a Hong Kong dollar bill, and our identity will not be found anywhere. Perhaps that’s why so many possibilities could happen at this moment.’\r\n\r\nThe two recent works are related to one of his best known pieces, Selling My Soul, which is also presented as part of this exhibition. Selling My Soul was first presented at the Tate Modern in the 2010 exhibition No Soul For Sale, which brought together various independent art organizations around the globe to participate in a large-scale group exhibition. In an piece presented by the Hong Kong-based Para:Site art space, Lam printed avatars of himself on small erasers, which he then used in an attempt to erase four large charcoal drawings. It was presented as a time-based performance piece that for Lam represented the all-consuming act of creating or ‘doing’ art, illustrated by the erasers that were consumed one by one. Turning the title of the exhibition on its head, Lam argued that the artist’s soul was in fact constantly being put up for sale, no matter the venue, going so far as to ‘question whether the independent art space is as independent as it always claims to be’.\r\n\r\nLao Tongli’s series of ink paintings began as a way to cope with his father’s long battle with heart disease, to which he succumbed after several surgeries and numerous hospital stays. Constantly conversing with doctors, and poring over charts and illustrations of human arteries and veins, Tongli began to incorporate the imagery of blood vessels into his artwork, where they evolved into a dense, layered labyrinth of interweaving colored lines. Painting with a traditional Chinese brush, his webs of overlapping lines become evocative of landscapes, natural root systems, or coral formations that seem to extend infinitely. Extremely labor-intensive, the artist views his work as an exercise in patience, and actively tries to ‘enjoy the physical labor’ involved with his creation process. Mindful of the spiritual connotations in his meditative approach to painting, Lao Tongli tries to ‘find freedom and nirvana’ through his work."

          "Kathryn Markel Fine Arts presents Liaisons, Nancy Cohen’s first solo show at the gallery.\r\n\r\nNancy Cohen is interested in the juxtaposition of fragility and strength, both in our personal lives and the environment. Her work investigates the journey of the individual navigating a perilous world, all while exploring the fragility of that world itself. Through personal study of waterways and collaborations with scientists and environmentalists, Cohen imbues her work with academic references to a natural world that is fighting back while constantly under threat.\r\n\r\nCohen shares these dualities in her choice of materials. She has been working with glass and handmade paper for over twenty years, drawn to how they transform along the way to the piece’s finished form. These materials allow for an implication of the body in the work, the necessary touch and adaptation to their malleability is evident in their construction. Their elements hang in the balance, each one necessary, vulnerable, and interdependent.\r\n \r\nThe pieces on view in Liaisons show the evolution of a body of work. Earlier pieces are constructed with a variety of found glasses that have been melted and reformed in a kiln over molds of clay, while newer works use glass made by Cohen. They are connected by ideas of form, experimentation with materials, and a balance of intuition and intention.  Heavily inspired by water, Cohen’s sculptures have an undulating, ethereal quality to them. They bring to mind images of eddies, seafoam, crashing waves, and the topography of waterways. They are inspired by the tension between industrial development and nature that’s abundant on the coast of New Jersey, intuitively responding to the forms, colors, and sounds that emerge as the coastline transforms over time.\r\n \r\nNancy Cohen has exhibited widely throughout the United States including at UrbanGlass, the Quark Park Sculpture Garden, The Sculpture Center, and the Staten Island Botanical Garden. She has been and Artist in Residence  at Bullseye Glass, WheatonArts, and Pilchuck Glass School and done residencies at Yaddo, MacDowell Colony, and Millay Colony. She is the recipient of several grants, including a Pollack Krasner Foundation Grant. Nancy Cohen has an MFA from Columbia University, and lives and works in Jersey City, New Jersey. \r\n"

          "Kathryn Markel Fine Arts presents Another Liquid Sentence, Daniel Brice’s second solo show at the gallery.\r\n\r\nDaniel Brice’s paintings are influenced by the minimalist environments of coastal California. They reference the hazy atmosphere above and in front of the earth, ocean, and sky. Their blurred boundaries translate to moody color fields with a simmering quietude, often grounded by abstract geometric form. \r\n\r\nReturning to oil after a stretch of working with watercolor, Brice can invigorate his layering technique with a more tactile quality. The layers are built up on the paper so that his process is evident, with the finished surfaces acquiring a sleek sheen.  All of his pieces begin with choosing a color and then, through intuition and color theory, Brice introduces each additional color to create supporting harmony or dissonance. The choices are poetic, even musical, and he ultimately strives to solve the puzzle each decision unlocks.  \r\n\r\nWhen viewing the finished piece, what first appears to be a minimal or monochromatic palette is then revealed to be built upon under-painting with a vast spectrum. Several works on view in Another Liquid Sentence are particularly reminiscent of the subtle complexity of the horizon line, mirroring the thin wide expanse where colors meet and blend. Others are darker, seemingly more internal, offering suggestions of formality. From brilliant blues to exploring shades of black, Brice’s paintings strive to be a reflection of the internal conversations one has while in a meditative state.\r\n \r\nDaniel Brice has exhibited widely throughout the United States, including at Chiaroscuro Contemporary Art, Western Project, and Riverside Museum of Art. His work is featured in many public and private collections. He lives and works in California. "

          "At EFA Project Space, 2nd Floor\r\n\r\nEFA Project Space presents Past Live, an exhibition produced by our 2016/17 SHIFT Residency artists. SHIFT Residency was launched in August 2010 to provide studio space and peer support for practicing artists who also work as arts professionals for organizations in New York City. This program honors these individuals with a unique environment to build on their own art practices. Six residents were selected based on their outstanding contributions to the art community plus their potential for artistic growth in a shared interactive environment. The unique nature of SHIFT Residency draws out unspoken challenges and considerations in the lives of its participating artists, who dedicate a significant portion of their time towards supporting other artists and the art community.\r\n\r\nAll artwork and programming presented in Past Live has been conceived of and created by the artists since they began SHIFT Residency in August 2016.  \r\n\r\nLiliana Dirks-Goodman is a New York based artist. She has a Bachelors and Masters degree in Architecture. She co-organizes AUNTS and makes installations and objects. These things have been seen and happened at the New Museum, chashama, Danspace Project, and Movement Research, among others. She has taught workshops at both the New Museum and Whitney Museum in New York City.\r\n\r\nAmy Jacobs is an artist and educator living in New York City. Using a textile-based exploration of imagery, she embraces traditional and experimental papermaking techniques, as well as book arts, collage and installation. She received a two-year Core Fellowship Residency at Penland School of Crafts in North Carolina and holds a Masters degree from Columbia College Chicago in Interdisciplinary Arts with a focus on Book &amp; Paper. Jacobs is currently a Studio Collaborator and Education Manager at Dieu Donné, a non-profit institution dedicated to serving artists through contemporary art in hand papermaking.\r\n\r\nMillie Kapp is a performance artist and teacher living and working in New York. In 2013, she graduated with an MA in Performance Studies from NYU and completed her undergraduate degree in 2010 with a BA from School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Kapp has presented her performance work in Oakland, Toronto, Philadelphia, Montreal, Minneapolis, Chicago and New York. \r\n\r\nMolly O’Brien creates opportunities for curatorial projects and collaborations between artists and students of all ages in New York public schools, directly connecting artists and arts organizations with the local community. Since 2010, she has served as Education Director at NURTUREart, a not-for-profit art organization and gallery in Brooklyn. Additionally, she is a Teaching Artist for the Guggenheim Museum’s Learning Through Art Program where she works with elementary school students in the Bronx and Brooklyn. She teaches kids how to be curious and steals their jokes.\r\n\r\nAntonio Serna is a multi-media artist with both a studio-based practice and a collective social-practice. His main concerns lay at the intersection of visual culture and the socio-political realms. For him these realms are inseparable and reciprocal: the manifestation of creativity and culture is the guiding spirit toward liberation and cultural self-determination, and vice versa. Moving between the two realms is crucial to his research and production as an artist. Originally from Texas, Antonio has organized projects in Berlin, Mexico, Spain, Romania, New York, Texas, and Las Vegas. Antonio Serna holds a Masters in Fine Arts from Brooklyn College, and a BFA from Parsons School of Art.\r\n\r\nTamas Veszi was born in Budapest in 1972. Veszi left Hungary at the age of 17 and finished his high school education in Israel. During this period he continued to draw and paint, but felt the need for greater physical contact with the material. As a consequence, he decided to study jewelry and jewelry design in Florence, Italy. He moved to New York in the fall of 1997. In 1998 he and several other residences of 70 Commercial Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn formed the group “Greenpoint Riverfront Artists.” They generated several performances, rooftop independent film screenings and the annual “Open Studio Tour.” In February 1998 he started his training as a Fine Art major at Pratt Institute. Tamas Veszi received his B.F.A in January 2000. Veszi attended Brooklyn College working on his M.F.A under the guidance of Elisabeth Murray and Vito Acconci and completed the program in 2006. Veszi currently lives and works in Brooklyn, Greenpoint. He had his first solo show at Allannederpelt Gallery in 2010. Since 2010, Veszi has participated in several exhibitions in New York and internationally. In 2016 Veszi has been nominated to the EFA SHIFT Residency program. \r\n"

          "No one writes lyric on a battlefield\r\nOn a map stuck with arrows\r\nBut I think I can do it if I just lurk\r\nIn my tent pretending to\r\nRefeather my arrows\r\n\r\n—Adrienne Rich, from Quarto, 2009\r\n\r\nGladstone Gallery presents Lyric on a Battlefield, a group exhibition organized by Miciah Hussey. The artists featured are: Kelly Akashi, Ellen Berkenblit, Louisa Clement, Anne Collier, Bracha L. Ettinger, Anish Kapoor, Liz Magor, f.marquespenteado, Suzanne McClelland, Dawn Mellor, Monique Mouton, Senga Nengudi, and Kandis Williams.\r\n\r\nBringing together artists working in various media, from multiple regions, and of different generations, this exhibition focuses on the lyric—the poetic first-person account of lived experience—to explore the complexities of being in the world. Mirroring the experimental and subjective nature of that form, the works included propose idiosyncratic methods of making visible critical, though complexly personal, interactions between the self and other. Through their translations of poetic reflection into the visual forms of painting, sculpture, drawing, and photography, these artists’ different practices expand intimate explorations of desire, social relations, and the environment. Each of these works propose a singular point of view to the viewer; one that asks them to empathize with the life of another as the means to understand the more obscure, complicated aspects of being that inform shared experience. While the lyric seemingly favors the aesthetic over the political, this exhibition seeks to understand how formal experimentation and analysis provides space to reimagine the life of the individual and ethical connections in a time of precarity.\r\n\r\nAs artist Bracha L. Ettinger said in a 2016 interview, “The purpose of art is not to represent reality or to aestheticize it. Art invents images and spaces. Art works like a maternal healing when it solicits against all the odds the human capacity to wonder, to feel awe, to feel compassion, to care, to trust and to carry the weight of the world.”"

          "The Center for Architecture presents Kaneji Domoto at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Usonia. Curated by Lynnette Widder, Lecturer in Discipline, Sustainability Management, at Columbia University, and designed by Studio Joseph, the exhibition presents the houses by Japanese American architect and Taliesin fellow Kaneji Domoto in Westchester County’s Usonia, a national historic district.\r\n\r\nThe community of Usonia in Pleasantville, founded in 1944, 35 miles north of New York City, is the only fully realized example of Wright’s vision for an exurban United States and a unique example of what it meant to design, and live, within Wright’s millieu. Wright designed the site plan and served on the building committee, defining the architectural style for the community, and eventually built three of the cooperative’s 47 homes. Five of the remaining houses in Usonia were designed by Kaneji Domoto, who used the houses to translate Wright’s idiom into low-cost construction.\r\n\r\nKaneji Domoto at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Usonia follows Domoto as an independent architect working in midcentury America, from his time at Taliesin, to his experiences in a Japanese internment camp in the southwest, to his work in Usonia and beyond. Through construction documents and original photography of his five Pleasantville houses, the exhibition explores Domoto’s architectural style, his references to Japanese design, and his connection to landscape architecture. Widder dives deep into the Lurie House, tracing the history of the home from construction, through the lives of the original occupants, and to Widder’s subsequent renovation and restoration.\r\n\r\nFeaturing material from private archives never-before shown publicly, the drawings, artifacts, models, letters, and photographs exhibited show how Domoto’s work applied Wrightian idiom and provide a glimpse at life in Frank Lloyd Wright’s inner circles. A site model of the Usonia community, custom-built by students at the Rhode Island School of Design, and furniture by Smilow Design, a company with roots in Usonia, will also be on display."

          "Klein Sun Gallery presents Ji Zhou: Real Illusion, the artist’s second solo exhibition with the gallery.\r\n\r\nUsing photography as his main medium, Beijing-based artist Ji Zhou’s most recent series of works chronicles the daily changes of light, texture, and activity within natural and urban scenes. By documenting instances of a place throughout the day and recompiling them, the circadian rhythm is collapsed creating a single atemporal image. As a result, we are presented with information that is both factual and illusory, similar to Claude Monet’s Rouen Cathedral Series (1892 - 1894) and Vincent Van Gogh’s Haystacks (1888).\r\n\r\nWith Building 3 (2017), Ji Zhou illustrates a reconstruction of a cityscape. He creates a collage by overlapping images of the same scene, each portrayed under a different degree of illumination. These segments of reality form the truest illusion, which embodies the core idea that inhabits this group of work: an inspection into our methodology of observing and forming conclusive judgments upon given information.\r\n\r\nEvolved from Ji Zhou’s series Ashes (2010) - photographs of landscapes and interior scenes covered in thick ash created by an accidental fire at the artist’s studio - his current wallpaper and photo installation, Plants covered in Dust (2016), utilizes both positives and negatives of the same image to create a juxtaposed version of black and white plants covered in soot. The installation challenges the audience’s perception of what they are truly seeing, much like his fragmented collages. His use of framed images within the installation invites us to reexamine how we observe what we see in these crafted duplicates of the wallpaper. Through creating this reality-based illusion of our world, instead of offering an explanation, Ji Zhou raises questions for which the best possible response for the viewer is to simply leave these questions unanswered.\r\n\r\nJi Zhou was born in Beijing, China, in 1970. He graduated with an MFA in Plastic Arts from the Panthéon-Sorbonne University in Paris, France, in 2005. His work has been exhibited around the world, including solo exhibitions Form, Space Kaan, Seoul, South Korea (2017); Civilized Landscape, Klein Sun Gallery, New York, NY (2015), Objectified Spectacle, Tang Contemporary Art, Beijing, China (2013) and In Situ, Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, China (2008). His recent group exhibitions include Imaginary Frontiers, Villa Empain - Fondation Boghossian, Brussels, Belgium (2017); Children of Hangzhou: Connecting with China, Young At Art Museum, Davie, FL (2016); Photography and Film Constructs, Ringling College of Art and Design, Sarasota, FL (2016); WALK!

Artists include: Kathy Butterly, Ling Chun, Future Retrieval, Valerie Hegarty, Cody Hoyt, Heidi Lau, Rebecca Morgan, Joakim Ojanen, Elise Siegel, Anthony Sonnenberg, Guðmundur Thoroddsen, and Cristina Tufiño.\r\n \r\n“Morph” is a snapshot of a resurgence of ceramic sculpture, and a re-contextualization borne of increasing celebration of clay’s malleability and many cultural reference points. Intentionally imperfect forms, unpolished surfaces, and allusions to figuration and traditional ceramic styles are all trademarks of the included artists. Elements of Art Brut hide within even sophisticated presentations. Each artist works in multiple media, signaling that ceramic is no one’s red-headed step-sister. The artists in “Morph” paint expressionistically with glaze, weave in hair, inlay surfaces, squash perfect forms, recombine tchotchkes, and subvert genres heedless of strict boundaries. Like the namesake British TV character, a staple of 1970’s children’s television and claymation icon, the artists in “Morph” twist this famously moldable material into conceptual and visual pretzels - much to our delight.\r\n "

          "BLANK SPACE presents an exhibition of Dutch artist Nemo Jantzen (b. 1970). This exhibition features the artist’s mixed media photography whose technique of disintegration is represented through a series of portraiture. \r\n\r\nConsisting of nine portraits, the exhibition will explore how changing perspectives demand new ways of seeing, and perception is arbitrated by the voice of media. The inception of Nemo Jantzen’s glamour portraiture formed as he explored the idea of how messages are indirectly delivered through media, which influences social behavior and perception of aesthetic. Jantzen created as the subject of each portrait iconic figures and poster faces commonly seen in advertisements, television, billboards and social media. Up close, the images of separate circles are cinematic stills or vintage photographs associated with the subject of the portrait. Magnified beneath resin and glass spheres, the individual photographs together with the alluring expression of the subject of the portrait convey a sense of voyeurism, as the visual spectacle draws the viewer to examine the work at a closer distance. Divided, yet whole when viewed collectively, the portraits explore the variable nature of perception. According to the artist, the portraits “reflect an idealized world filtered through the demands of the eye of the beholder.”\r\n\r\nInspired by manipulation of perspective in cinematography, and productivity of digital photography, Nemo Jantzen mastered the innovative technique of piecing together globular units to form an image of a photograph, thereby blurring the lines between Photorealism and Pop Art. He gathers hundreds of photographs, sorts them by color and theme, and employs them as building blocks of his mixed media photography. This experimental approach, as the artist describes, is “taking Neo-Pointillism to a new level.” Distinct pixelated units of color are arranged to give just enough information for the viewer to form an image of the subject in the mind.\r\n\r\nNemo Jantzen (b. 1970) was born in The Hague, Netherlands, to a family of artists and musicians. From an early age he acquired a passion for visual arts, and went on to study art and design at the RTO Art Academy in Rotterdam. He began his formative years as a graphic designer and billboard artist, in Antwerp, Belgium, and later pursued his passion for Fine Art in Spain. Mastering his distinct technique and artistic style, he gained recognition and acclaim from galleries and collectors internationally.

          "11R presents New Conditions, an exhibition of new works by Italian born, New York-based artist Alessandro Teoldi. Teoldi’s practice encompasses installation, sculpture, photography, and textiles.\r\n\r\nThe series exhibited employs airplane inflight blankets collected by the artist, either through his own travels, friends and family, or from online stores such as Ebay or Etsy. The blankets, collected from different airlines, different times, and different places, are roughly cut and sewn together to form figurative representations of intimacy, seclusion, and embrace. Teoldi’s work grapples with the human need for community, closure, and comfort in a world that is dominated by the alienating forces of separation and consumption. The inflight blankets series analyzes the affective relationships that people establish with things and other people through the role of “transitional objects”, a term coined by pediatrician and psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott. Transitional objects, such as blankets and teddy bears, serve as an important bridge between ‘the self’ and ‘the other’ as developing children start to see themselves as a separate entity from their mothers.\r\n\r\nAirline blankets, mass produced and embroidered with airline logos, bring individuals a sense of calm and comfort in an otherwise confined, huddled, and noisy airplane. In a transient period, soaring between two nodes of certainty, their softness and weight provide a familiar sense of home and bodily content. They transition us from a sense of discomfort to protection, from a naked public anxiety to a warm, private, consolation as they themselves transition from a generalized commodity designed for no one to the fulfillment of a specific, individual desire. As the person moves from the public to the private, from general to specific, the blanket follows suit. Despite being surrounded by others, we are reminded of our isolation and alienation; we employ blankets to replace a confidant.\r\n\r\nIn Teoldi’s works, the gestures of hands become a dual symbol that signifies shame as well as reprieve. In the grip of shame, we cover our faces to conceal ourselves; in a moment of intimacy, we embrace our loved ones to soothe them with a gentle and familiar touch. Recognition through touch feeds back into the materiality of the work itself — rough cuts through the fabric, the layering of different textures, and the visible stress of the fabric as it wraps snuggly around the stretcher bars, hugging the corners, are a tantalizing reminder of the tactile nature of the blankets. We desire these qualities in blankets because we ultimately desire it in other people.\r\n\r\nAlessandro Teoldi is a New York-based artist born in Milan, Italy in 1987. He received his MFA from ICP-Bard College, New York and a BA in Photography from Istituto Europeo di Design, Milan. He has exhibited in venues including Baxter St at CCNY, New York; Spazio Morris, Milan; Artspace, New Haven; International Center of Photography, New York; Art Verona, Verona among others. He was one of the 2015 Workspace residents at Baxter St at The Camera Club of New York. Curatorial projects include Each Evening We See the Sunset at Spazio Morris, Milan (2013); Collected Goods (2014) and Driveway (2014) both at independent venues in Brooklyn and Queens, NY."

          "David Nolan Gallery presents Kink and Politics: The Ties That Bind, an exhibition curated by Wardell Milan. The exhibition explores the ideas of sexual deviance and government legislation - which Milan finds associations between in the work of the ten participating artists.\r\n \r\nAccording to the curator: “A closer look at the ideas of kink and politics feels seasonable as sexuality and the notion of gender transitions are questioned, as immigration and borders all are disputed, and as the ‘other’ perennially creates safe spaces with the hope of bringing forth the feeling of freedom. It is the consideration of how moral and social conformity and legislative politics serve as a structure to champion as well as to challenge and revoke.”\r\n \r\nThe work of Felipe Baeza (b. 1987, Guanajuato, Mexico) serves as an account of the artist’s own status as an immigrant living in the United States. The figures that he frequently depicts are reflective of the bodies smuggled across the Mexican border. William Cordova’s (b. 1969, Lima, Peru) practice explores the metaphysics of temporality, synthesizing different historical and geographical moments as a form, and proposing social commonalities. \r\n \r\nJohnathan Payne’s (b. 1980, Houston, Texas) large-scale collages begin with digital scans of adult magazines, which he subsequently prevents the viewer from perceiving straightforwardly as he transforms them into abstract patterned outlines. Focusing on glory holes - typically defined as a hole in the wall used in homosexual encounters - Lucas Michael (b. 1965, Buenos Aires, Argentina) makes paint and graphite on wood paintings that simultaneously celebrate and mystify these urban spaces.\r\n \r\nMelvin Harper (b. United Kingdom) appropriates a variety of moving images from old science fiction B-movies to courtroom footage and cell phone videos - narrative devices woven together as a comment on racial disparity throughout society and the criminal justice system in particular. The notion of physical struggle is evident in Linda Gallagher’s (b. 1978, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania) paintings and drawing where grappling figures simultaneously suggest intimacy and aggression.\r\n \r\nThe theme of physical bondage as a sexualized and potentially repressive element is evident in the works of Christina Ramberg (b. 1946, Kentucky, d. 1995, Chicago, Illinois) whose drawings often include partial images of heads and body parts, bandaged and wrapped. Part of the loose confederation that came to be called the Chicago Imagists, the group also included Ed Paschke (1939-2001, Chicago, Illinois) who is represented in the exhibition by two drawings from 2002.\r\n \r\nIn Senga Nengudi’s (b. 1943, Chicago, Illinois) audio recording resembling an NPR-like radio program, the artist interviews various leaders of a fictitious nation-state whose major export is art and creativity. The Brooklyn-based writer and performer Morgan Bassichis (b. 1983) will undertake a performance, in direct response to the other artists installed in the exhibition, at the gallery during the opening reception on Thursday, June 22, at 7pm."

          "Karma presents an exhibition of a new sculpture by Robert Grosvenor.\r\n\r\nThree objects sit in the gallery. Things that don’t appear to be of this time or even from this realm—like they fell from the sky, or were dug up fossils—inasmuch as they appear as superlative objects at first sight. Three vessels. The first, a bright yellow machine with it’s doors welded shut. No door handles. All of the seams are filled, it’s lines are smoothed and it’s corners pointed. Inside of it are four seats but no way to access them. It’s headlights and taillights are removed and painted over, leaving it impaired. It appears like it’s freshly emerged from it’s mold, after a dusty, yellow unnatural substance was poured in. A foggy piece of plexiglas—foreign to it’s surroundings—sit’s like a lid on the top. \r\n\r\nOn the other end is a mottled-brown-gray, rusted machine. Windowless, or rather without glass. It’s front is smoothed out and similarly it’s lights are missing—and whether they even existed to begin with continues to question it’s functionality. A fin on it’s back indicates speed and aerodynamics—but it’s hard to imagine how it can propel or steer. Its skin, pierced with cuts and slits, creates an appearance of a living and breathing thing.\r\n\r\nIn the center sits a small green vehicle, with three wheels, seemingly the most functional of the lot but no less illogical or esoteric than it’s partners. It has all—or most—of the ingredients to articulate that it was or could be driven—seats, steering wheel, gas pedal, gearshift, even keys and a license plate—but it’s function, while marginally present is almost always inaccessible. \r\n \r\n\r\n“We must not forget that an object is the best messenger of a world above that of nature: one can easily see in an object at once a perfection and an absence of origin, a closure and brilliance, a transformation of life into matter.”\r\n(Roland Barthes)\r\n\r\nContinuing to investigate positions between stillness and movement, Grosvenor’s sculptures seem to be things that are at a mid-way point, neither functionless or functional, both recognizable and absurd—always coming so close to both ends at the same time and resisting interpretation and challenging the limits of industrial fabrication. Smoothness has for some time been an attribute associated with perfection because it’s opposite reveals a typically human operation of assembling. From afar, Three Car Unit is a group of smooth, slick machines built at the height of technological advancements of their period and place, however from a shorter distance and slower time, perspective shifts and an artists labor is revealed. Through formal conventions of sculpture making, such as the manipulation of material and form, Grosvenor often establishes relationships between strangers. Unsuspecting objects, unfamiliar textures, and unconventional colors are often the divergent components with which he constructs a scene. The three objects, sitting on wheels—a sort of built in pedestal—seem on the verge of turning into something else, as much as they seem like they could roll away. \r\n\r\nRobert Grosvenor (b. 1937) was born in New York City and studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in France and the Universitá di Perugia in Italy. Important one-person exhibitions of Grosvenor’s work have been presented at Fundação de Serralves, Porto (2005), Kunsthalle Bern (1992) and P.S.1, New York (1984). Selected group exhibitions include the Whitney Biennial, Whitney Museum, New York (1973 and 2010), Primary Structures at the Jewish Museum, New York (1966), American Sculpture for the 60’s, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles (1967), Sonsbeek 71, Sonsbeek Park, Arnhem, The Netherlands (1971). Grosvenor’s work is included in the collections of the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Storm King Art Center, New York, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and Museum Boymans-van Beuningen Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\r\n "

          "Leila Heller Gallery presents a new body of work by Iranian-American artist Afruz Amighi, No More Disguise.   “We are a country of civil war, and from the eternal divide, the ever present rift, lifting their heads and making themselves known, faces emerge.”  Amighi continues, “I cover them with headdresses I have made, to protect them, to reveal them, to honor and ridicule them.”   The Emperor, the Empress, the Fool, the Warrior, the Beheaded, the Unborn: in a series of six graphite and six sculptural wall reliefs, composed as headdresses, Amighi renders a procession of passion and derision, formally presenting the figure in her oeuvre for the first time in a poetical invocation of the masquerade of power, or what the artist calls, “heroes and villains … emerging from our new social and political landscape.”\r\n \r\nAt once highly personal and political, Amighi’s sculptural and figural reliefs compose a study in power—for the artist a parade of the glorious and the damned.  Derived from reflection on the history of disposed empires, from the Mughals, who reigned over the Indian subcontinent until being deposed by the East India company in the 19th century, to the Native American, whose various tribal lands extended from sea to shining sea prior to the arrival of Columbus, each work in this processional reveals a layering of moribund heraldry in the form of headdresses, feathers, fine jewelry, and adornments: signifiers of triumph from another age. “Each headdress is bedecked with a crown, but the chains that fall from them, however opulent, suggest bondage, in a coffle of regal figures … there is the echo of lost power.  They are a study in the strange anatomy of love and death, agency and oppression,” imparts the artist.\r\n \r\nAlthough known for her elegant studies in the inanimate and architectural, this new body of figural works continues to utilize the artist’s intricate strategies of shadow and light, replete with an elaborate architectonics.  As Art Historian Claire Brandon states in the catalogue essay to accompany this exhibition, “Their serpentine curves, ornate metalwork, and careful craftsmanship recall the debauchery of Jazz Age America and the curving geometry and stylized lines of art deco jewelry, furniture, and architecture.”  Indeed, having at once powerfully and delicately engaged in the structures of her Iranian-American heritage in her previous work, this figural turn in the artist’s oeuvre also signifies a domestic concern.  As Brandon notes, “at stake in these works are the cycle of decadence and depression and the perpetual state of civil strife that in part define the United States, the artist’s home for over 30 years.”\r\n"

          "Elisa Contemporary Art presents “Rooted Down and Rising Up”. This three-woman show features artists Amy Cheng, Sara V. Cole and Michelle Gagliano.\r\n\r\nOur artists draw their influences from nature – the flowers, leaves and vines – deeply rooted in the world all around us to portray the complex connections into the human mind, body, soul, and spirit. \r\n\r\nThe featured artists utilize a range of creative mediums and styles. California artist Sara V. Cole, debuting with Elisa Contemporary Art, uses layers of torn and hand cut paper leaves and botanical shapes sometimes up to 300 pieces, collaged with acrylic paints. According to Cole, ” I utilize hybridized botanical shapes to visualize the interactions of nature and the human condition…I am searching for balance …to find the mindful ECA_RisingUp.SaraCole30x30.middle ground that can sustain both the bountiful and destructive nature of our humanity.” \r\n\r\nVirginia artist, Michelle Gagliano, combines imaginary ‘natural’ forms with textural patinas creating breathtaking panoramas that both evoke timeless private visions and invoke universal themes and emotions. According to Gagliano, “My current body of work further reduces and deconstructs the landscape, reflecting and refracting the prism of light and soul in a contemporary concept… I see my work as a kind of mapping of natural beauty. Maps themselves to me are like veins of the earth, like the body itself.” \r\n\r\nChinese artist, Amy Cheng, works with oil on paper and on Canvas using patterns from around the world. According to Cheng, “I align myself with the long tradition of geometric and floral ornamentation the Far Eastern, Middle Eastern, &amp; European craftsmen have long employed. They did so with the implicit understanding that pattern &amp; repetition, which are endemic in nature, are primal in their rhythmic connection to the human nervous system.” "

          "bitforms gallery presents a group exhibition highlighting key works from artists participating in the upcoming season. For the first time the gallery will be presenting works by Gary Hill, a foundational figure in video art. The exhibition will also feature new work by Daniel Canogar, Beryl Korot, Sara Ludy, Jonathan Monaghan, and Addie Wagenknecht.\r\n\r\nAfter our successful fifteen-year anniversary season, we are looking forward to another long run of exhibitions critically engaged with experimental media and technology.\r\n\r\nGary Hill’s Klein Bottle with the Image of Its Own Making (after Robert Morris) is modeled after the mathematical form in which inside and outside are ambiguous instead being one continuous surface. The artist made a video recording of the bottle being made and projected it “inside” the form, a direct reference to Robert Morris’s Box with the Sound of Its Own Making from 1961.\r\n\r\nAnother work by Hill, Liminal Object #7 is a part of an ongoing series of black-and-white works utilizing simple computer animation. The images are displayed on a 14-inch monitor that has been removed from its housing and placed on a metal platform. Each work in the series involves two objects that violate each other’s physical and symbolic borders in unpredictable ways. Liminal Object #7 features an apple and a gyroscope. The apple sits in stillness while the gyroscope moves in, around, and through it in a repetitive interaction, its wobbly axis encircling the apple’s stem.\r\n\r\nDaniel Canogar creates three-dimensional installations that conceptualize media as sculpture. After years of research, he has pioneered a technique with flexible LED tiles. This enables him to create screens with a membrane-like quality that can conform to multiple surfaces, objects, and architectures. Echo is made using the artist’s signature approach and features an abstract, generative animation that is occasionally disrupted by moiré patterns. These visual interferences are triggered by real-time seismic activity across the globe. The result is an ever-changing unique gestural composition.\r\n\r\nFor Beryl Korot, threads (whether wool, linen, or magnetic tape) are both metaphor and medium. Curves references her seminal multichannel video and textile installation, Text and Commentary, which places ancient and contemporary technologies in dialog, tracing the origin of the computer to the loom. In this new series of abstract drawings, this exchange is continued through the exploration of the mark of the artist’s hand and that of the machine. A sewing machine is programmed to sew the surface of the paper in pre-designated areas. The texture, color, and shape of the sewn thread contextualizes and converses with the original hand-drawn marks.\r\n\r\nSara Ludy’s Deep Pond is the newest animation from the series Clouds that pushes the constraints of software defaults to evoke natural phenomena. Through extensive layering of amorphous movement, Deep Pond emerges as a cosmic field swimming with artificial lifeforms. Without the use of outside source material, these animations are generated from within their native program as intuitive manifestations. Clouds reflects the desire to explore computer systems in order to find a personal connection with machines.\r\n\r\nJonathan Monaghan’s 24k Magic in the Air distorts the ornate Beaux Arts facade of the St. Regis hotel in New York into a sculptural wall-relief. Unthinkably wealthy warring real estate, rail, and oil barons shaped the history of the iconic hotel, which today rivals competitors like the Waldorf-Astoria and Trump Tower. Monaghan gives its Neo-Baroque exterior a dystopian update with 3D printed acrylate and gold plated brass that speaks to the luxe sham of capitalism.\r\n\r\nEvoking dread and uncertainty surrounding wealth, authority, and consumerism, the works in the ongoing series Police State Condo appear like advertisements for luxury apartments yet are permeated by an ominous foreboding. Security cameras, TSA checkpoints, and distorted ATM machines seamlessly blend with designer fabrics and penthouse views. Composed of both two-dimensional imagery and 3D printed sculptural reliefs, the works explore the space between the virtual and physical; imagination and reality. Chase What Matters depicts a panopticon-like orb floating in front of columns of windows. Its core contains ornate golden spikes that appear to be monstrous teeth in a jet black mouth.\r\n\r\nAddie Wagenknecht’s solitaire and cheat codes dye sublimation prints nostalgically recollect the aesthetics of early Windows operating systems. Since 1990, Microsoft has included Windows Solitaire in the pre-installed software for the OS and it has since become a symbol of the era. solitaire and cheat codes reminisces on the glitchy sequence of repeated bouncing cards that is displayed after a player wins the classic game. The series introduces the dated visual to a contemporary context by replacing Susan Kare’s iconic cards with items such as donuts, cash, Tesla cars, and more."

          "Brushless is a summer group exhibition that explores the margins of painterly process. It features artists who choose to apply paint using non-brush tools and techniques with idiosyncratic and often surprising results. Though each artist’s ends remain unique, paint’s fickle and fertile materiality is at play throughout.\r\n \r\nNathan Randall Green’s site-specific paintings are created by rolling latex paint directly onto the wall, mixing hues wet-into-wet and sometimes masking off certain areas to achieve tighter boundaries and contrast. These wall-based works are comically jazzy riffs on geometric abstraction that activate interior space through bold color and formal directionality.\r\n \r\nUsing a homemade atomizer, Halsey Hathaway deploys his own breath to propel colored inks onto masked, cut, and collaged paper surfaces. These quasi-pointillist paintings gain their power from subtle chromatic shifts and hard-edged, lyrical geometries that inscribe the boundaries of the support and suggest a sort of corporeal architecture.\r\n \r\nWayne Herpich’s tool of choice is the palette knife. In these paintings, the artist slabs on juicy swaths of oil in sprawling, almost prose-like bands, and exploits swaggering wet-into-wet painterly effects to vibratory, highly optical ends. With his signature mixture of exuberance and virtuosic rigor, Herpich challenges the challengers of pictorial abstraction.\r\n\r\nHildur Ásgeirsdóttir Jónsson stains the fibers of her warp and weft and weaves them together on a 10-foot loom to produce shimmering, vibrant silk wall hangings that straddle the worlds of painting and tapestry. Though abstract, the works’ imagery is based on photographic views of an array of subjects, including brain scans, microorganisms, and the landscape of the artist’s native Iceland.\r\n \r\nRachel Ostrow wields a squeegee to push oil paint across the glassy smooth planes of her meticulously prepared wood panels, revealing richly layered alla prima color amalgamations and nullifications. Ostrow’s paintings are screen-like in their size, clarity, and sense of projected light, and celebrate the incidental surprises of paint in motion.\r\n \r\nIn this series of paintings, Carolanna Parlato pours fluid acrylic directly onto canvas and, by tilting the stretcher in different directions at various degrees of inclination, commands the paint to run, streak, ooze, and dribble into riotously colorful biomorphic compositions that reenergize process-based Color Field painting tropes with Pop attitude and sculptural presence.\r\n \r\nSoaking his clothes and bedsheets in viscous oil paint, Andrew Schwartz drags, rubs, and stamps onto primed canvas, building up surfaces that are both imagistic and densely material. The results are abstract and suggestive, making reference to the body through their legible labor as well the symbolic and autobiographical nature of the tools involved."

The exhibition titled Beyond Water presents a captivating selection of Chernichaw’s water series.\r\n \r\nPauline Chernichaw’s minimal and pictorial photographic abstractions evoke a sense of visual stimulation, emotive delight and spiritual meditation. By exploring the core of water’s life-force, Chernichaw reveals her multi-layered perception and inherent connection to what is “beyond the water’s surface. Chernichaw’s observant eye gazes beyond the surface of the ocean, ponds, creeks and rivers visually immersing herself in fields of color, line and organic forms. Her water series mirrors an endlessly moving and infinitely shifting water scape."

          "Microscope Gallery presents Face Shifts, a group exhibition of works including video, kinetic painting, analog photography, installation and mixed media by Theodore Darst, Nick Doyle, Rina Dweck, Ja’tovia Gary, Kevin Reuning, and Jessie Stead in which the face is a focus of the work and its manifestation a reflection upon the technologies from which it is made.\r\n\r\nWhile the face has become ubiquitous in recent years – aided by the development of hand-held devices of communication with screens and cameras, numerous social media platforms, and advancements in security and surveillance technologies such as facial recognition, among others – the works in Face Shifts move away from realistic representation, or the appearance thereof toward highly personal re-imaginations, deconstructions, and social commentary.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the works by the six artists in the exhibition use or incorporate a full range of analog and digital technologies and mediums – often in hybrid forms – from celluloid film, rare Polaroid formats, mp3 and transistors to current flat screens, 3D animation and gaming platforms often combined with more traditional practices including scratching, painting, etching, and assemblage.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nTheodore Darst is an artist living and working in New York City. His work was recently featured in “Cult Trash”, a solo exhibition at Magenta Plains, New York. Additionally his work was recently exhibited in “storefront: This Known World” at The Museum Of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, CA, “Dreamlands: Immersive Cinema and Art, 1905–2016” at The Whitney Museum of American Art in New York as part of Lorna Mills’ project “Ways of Something, Episode 1”, and the Artists’ Film Biennial at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, England in 2016. His first book “Cult Trash” was published by Soft City Publishing on the occasion of his exhibition at Magenta Plains.\r\n\r\nNick Doyle was raised in Los Angeles, CA. He received his BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 2005, and earned an MFA from Hunter College in 2013. He attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in the summer of 2014 and subsequently attended the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s studio residency program from 2014-2017. Doyle’s work has exhibited at Invisible Exports (New York, NY), Lucien Terras (New York, NY), Columbia University (New York, NY), Abrons Art Center (New York, NY) and Pioneer Works (Brooklyn, NY). He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\nRina Dweck is a multi-media artist whose work explores themes of identity and disguise in our contemporary world. In her recent 365 piece Project Face (2011-2012), Dweck took a selfie with her iPhone and posted it on her Facebook page every day for one year. She has participated in residencies at the Vermont Studio Center (2013, 2014, 2016) and the Mayapple Center for Arts and Humanities (2014). Her work has been featured in the Huffington Post and other art publications. She holds a B.S. in Studio Art from NYU (1998) and is currently in the MFA Fine Arts Program at The School of Visual Arts, in New York. Dweck lives and works in New York.\r\n\r\nJa’Tovia Gary is a filmmaker and visual artist originally from Dallas, Texas currently living and working in Brooklyn, New York. Gary’s work is concerned with constructions of power and how raced and gendered beings navigate popular media. She earned her MFA in Social Documentary Filmmaking from the School of Visual Arts in New York. Her work has screened at festivals, cinemas, and institutions worldwide including Edinburgh International Film Festival, The Whitney Museum, Anthology Film Archives, Atlanta Film Festival, the Schomburg Center, MoMa PS1, MOCA Los Angeles, New Orleans Film Festival, Ann Arbor Film Festival, the Museum of Modern Art and elsewhere. She is the recipient of the Sundance Documentary Fund Production Grant and the Jerome Foundation Film and Video Grant.

His work often involves visual explorations of virtual worlds and sculptures he creates using 3D elements assembled via software or collected from the web. Reuning’s work has been previously featured in group and solo shows at the gallery as well as at Boston University Art Gallery, NurtureArt, and Pratt Digital Arts Gallery among others. Reuning’s work has been featured in Artsy, ArtFCity, Artlyst (UK), and ArtObserved, among others. He released his first ebook “A Few Visuals” in September 2014. Kevin Reuning graduated in 2012 from Boston University in Film and Science.\r\n\r\nJessie Stead works in overlapping patterns of cinema, installation, music and other forms of cross-disciplined art.

          "NORTH GALLERY . FRANCESCO RUSSO\r\n \r\nSicilian-born artist Francesco Russo left the language of western modernism behind to devote himself entirely to the creation of timeless spiritual symbols.  A Hindu-influenced vision gives rise to drawings, paintings and sculptures capturing and confronting us with higher energies and messages from another dimension, which can lead to self-knowledge, transformation and healing.\r\n \r\nBased on illustrated Hindu texts from the 17th century, a collection of 26 drawings are painted with gouache, watercolor and tempera on rough, fibrous paper. The images have been created and re-created by subsequent generations of artists. Over time, the text was separated from the image, leaving only crisp, symbolic compositions as an aid for private meditation.\r\nFrancesco Russo’s paintings vibrate. This vibration is due not so much to the color of the paintings as to a spiritual content, which they offer generously. What makes the work generous is that it is not just a moment in the artist’s mental process, but that it enables its energy to have a continuing effect in the viewer’s mind. As a result of a long process with a purifying effect, each painting shows evidence of the moment in which seeking makes way for finding and duality transitions into unity and concentration.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMBER . TOMAS VAVRICEK . Carburetor\r\n \r\nCzech born visual artist Tomas Vavricek presents an interactive audiovisual installation titled Carburetor that invites the viewer into a sacred space made of lights, fabric and visual projections. It is an installation derived from ideas of technology and augmented reality, which builds upon his previous installations inspired by the book by famous Czech writer Karel Capek The Absolute At Large. The science fiction novel written in 1922 depicts a machine called Carburetor that turns humans into gods. The first sentence opens the story on New Year’s Day 1943 and describes the fundamental transformations in society as the result of a new mystical source of virtually free energy. Tomas Vavricek’s installation is an abstract association of how such a machine might look like.\r\n \r\nSOUTH GALLERY: (2007) 2 (2008) &amp; (2009)\r\n \r\nLUC CLAUS\r\nA purified language, the fruit of a profound spiritual reflection towards art, characterizes the work of Belgian artist Luc Claus. Refusing to see his work in terms of ideas rather than feelings, the artist looked for the essence of the human figure by stripping down the ideas and convictions that moved him. It was a long philosophical way that led to a graphical search for the ultimate and ideal representation.\r\n \r\nAUDE DU PASQUIER GRALL\r\nAude du Pasquier Grall started the Male Cycle in 1998. The multi-media project features a different man for each male cycle and each identity corresponds to a particular cycle. The artist’s work is formally new even if, instructed by the history of art, it induces the mind to play with anachronistic alliances. One could, for instance, link a photograph taken from cycle n°4 (the man with an orange) to Bronzino’s painting Allegory of Venus, Love and Time. Both works feature a well-balanced composition of an artificial world, strange and sensual. The anti-naturalist bias, the improbable and contorted attitudes of the bodies, the mannerist colors, the intertwined themes of love, death and time, and even the representation of the golden apple — symbol of beauty — are echoed in both works. The model’s legs, flexed and joined together suggest an inverted deposition from the cross. Around him, flowers and fruit (oranges), normally the attributes of youth and fertility are carefully arranged on the ground so as to evoke a vanitas painting.\r\n \r\nTHÉO MERCIER\r\nThéo Mercier juxtaposes the real and the artificial, the mundane and the extraordinary, the traditional and the radical. He functions as an experimental chemist, combining ordinary objects and social references in a lab, which result in sublime mutations. The recycling of the ordinary is apparent in Slayer Fan. Locks of Barbarella blond hair attached to a standard functioning ceiling fan result in a vulgar yet divine tribute to the intensity of rock.\r\n \r\nSIMON HENWOOD\r\nA recurrent theme in Henwood’s paintings and mixed-media works has been the exploration of the complex social and cultural terrain of childhood and adolescence. Narrative themes are characterized by a frank, mundane realism derived from Pop art and photography. It is done with such artistic depth that it provides his work with a naturalistic dimension. Moving from a semi-expressionist form of pop art, he developed a highly personal realistic style, producing images saturated with color in which longing, emptiness and solitude all hang in the air. His meticulously executed realist paintings, imbued with a pervasive mood of alienation, are noble, lyrical, loving and also capture something fundamental, a diaristic directness. They bring about a sense of life and energy yet still capture that feeling of abandonment and solitude hiding deep within his subjects."

          "The Mere Future is an exhibition examining the relationship between artistic production and the erosion of the public sphere. In varying ways, the seven artists in this exhibition take the urban landscape as emblematic of the constellations of social and economic power that undergird the art world. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition looks in particular to one of the unexpected but well-documented legacies of post-conceptual practices and institutional critique-namely, that reflexivity to the politics of representation, audience and display is thoroughly compatible with contemporary art’s role as one of the main financial engines behind the catastrophic transfers of wealth from the private to the public sector over the past three decades. With art’s corruptibility firmly in mind, The Mere Future presents work that negotiates complicity with the potential for renewal and the possibility of a new commons. \r\n\r\nAt a moment when the President of the United States is an ex-property developer, many of the exhibition’s works carry explicit or implicit traces of New York City’s voracious real estate market. Devon Dikeou presents a sculpture she first showed in 1992, a replica of one the planters in the lobby of Trump Tower. Joel Dean’s sculpture cartoonishly probes the affects of the city’s architectural marvels, locating them on a continuum between power and submission. Nils Norman contributes a series of plans for a proposed redevelopment of Battery Park City, including a redesign of Richard Artschwager’s public art piece “Sitting Stance” as a gentrification advice kiosk, presented here for the first time since they were shown at American Fine Arts Co., New York in 1999. The Half Moon Bay Center for Theatre and Performance Art’s new commission is a mumblecore-inspired short film depicting a young artist navigating the depressingly predictable economic and social realities of the New York art world. \r\n\r\nThe two drawings contributed by Stephen Kaltenbach, executed in 1970, escape the city, seeming to depict suburban and country homes, but finding hierarchies of taste equally entrenched there. Amy Lien and Enzo Camacho explore the circulation of cultural capital in the ever-shrinking loop between center and periphery in a series of photographs of the traditional Filipino dish, champorado, taken at a well-known cafe in the bohemian-artistic/eco-touristic Baguio City, Philippines. Finally, Marc Kokopeli references Yoko Ono’s Wish Tree series with his own version, virtually unchanged from the original, a melancholic acknowledgement of a political imaginary in stalemate as much as a call to reconstruct the future. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition borrows its title from Sarah Schulman’s prescient 2009 novel about liberal hubris, whose dystopic vision of New York City, where all social problems have finally been solved, suggests the provincialism bound up in fantasies of urban progress. \r\n\r\nJoel Dean (born 1986) lives and works in New York City. He graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with a Bachelors of Fine Art in 2009, and co-founded Important Projects in Oakland the same year, helping to oversee the space’s program through 2014. He has had solo and two-person exhibitions at Species, Atlanta (2016); ISCP, New York (2016); Weekends, London (2016); Princess, New York (2015); Lodos, Mexico City (2014); and Jancar Jones, Los Angeles (2013). \r\n\r\nDevon Dikeou is an artist, editor/publisher of zingmagazine , and co-founder of the Dikeou Collection, based in Denver. She lives in Austin, Denver, and New York City. She has exhibited her work at the New Museum, the Contemporary Austin, Artpace San Antonio, FLAG Art Foundation, NADA, the Armory Show, the Independent, James Fuentes, 179 Canal, Moore College of Art, MAMCO, and the Bronx Museum, among many other venues. Later in June, she will open a show at James Fuentes in New York. Dikeou received an MFA from School of Visual Arts, New York and an undergraduate degree from Brown University. \r\n\r\nHalf Moon Bay Center for Theatre &amp; Performance Art comprises Rafael Delacruz, Marc Matchak and Quintessa Matranga. Established in 2005, the group creates films depicting nihilism and humor in the artist life. Their work, in testing the aesthetic parameters of omphaloskepsis, attempts to taunt audience preconceptions of artistic and social ontology. Operating largely between California and New York City their output would not be possible without a grant from the city of Half Moon Bay and equipment donations from various public media outlets. \r\n\r\nStephen Kaltenbach (born 1940) is one of the most important and prolific figures in American conceptual art. He was featured in landmark group exhibitions organised by the movement’s foremost advocates - Seth Siegelaub ( March , 1969), Harald Szeemann ( Live in Your Head: When Attitudes Become Form , 1969), and Lucy Lippard (955,000, 1970) - as well as presenting solo exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1969) and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1967). \r\n\r\nKaltenbach’s work was included in other definitive exhibitions of conceptual and minimal art including: 9 at Castelli , Castelli Warehouse, New York (1968); 557,087 , Seattle Art Museum (1969); and Information , Museum of Modem Art, New York (1970). Since the 1970s, Kaltenbach’s work has been included in many conceptual art surveys including 1965-1975: Reconsidering The Object As Art , Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (1995); Under the Big Black Sun , Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2011); ENDS OF THE EARTH: Land Art to 1974 , MOCA, Los Angeles (2012) and Haus der Kunst, Munich (2012); When Attitudes Become Form: Bern 1969/Venice 2013 , Prada Foundation, Venice (2013); Materializing “Six Years” : Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art , Brooklyn Museum (2013). \r\n\r\nMarc Kokopeli (born 1987) is an artist based in New York City. \r\n\r\nAmy Lien (born 1987) and Enzo Camacho (born 1985) have been collaborating since 2009. Their practice has existed through a series of geographic displacements: between their respective home cities of New York and Manila; and recent periods living and working in Berlin, Milan, and Singapore. Accordingly, their work reflects different models of organizing around art-particularly “contemporary art”-both within and outside its supposed centers. They have had recent solo exhibitions at 47 Canal (New York, USA) and Mathew Gallery (Berlin, Germany), and most recently, they were Artists-in-Residence at the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore and Gluck50 in Milan. They have recently co-authored N ear Contact with David Joselit, a publication released by Common Practice in New York, and have started to write Southeast Churva, an online column for Flash Art. \r\n\r\nNils Norman (born 1966) is an artist living in London who works across the disciplines of public art, architecture and urban planning. He has completed major public art projects in Roskilde, Denmark and Bristol, UK, and has designed playgrounds in Bristol, UK and Cardiff, Wales. Norman has developed commissions for Museum De Domijnen, Sittard, the Netherlands; Western Front, Vancouver, Canada; Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfallen, Düsseldorf, Germany; SculptureCenter, New York; Creative Time, New York; the London Underground; the Tate Modern, London, and participated in the 50th Venice Biennale. He has also had solo gallery presentations at Galerie Christian Nagel, Germany; American Fine Arts, Co., New York; Friesenwall 120, Cologne; and with Stephen Dillemuth at Vilma Gold, London and Reena Spaulings, New York."

          "James Cohan presents the group exhibition Dream Machines. The exhibition considers the point at which the real and the imaginary cease to be perceived as contradictory. As discourses of reality/unreality become an increasingly dominant feature of our day to day lives, Dream Machines posits that artists can navigate across both collecting meaning along the way. The exhibition brings together artists from different generations and nationalities, using a diverse range of materials and processes including David Altmejd, Omer Fast, Trenton Doyle Hancock, Mernet Larsen, Lee Mullican, Jon Rafman, Tabaimo, and Fred Tomaselli. \r\n\r\nKey to the exhibition are a selection of drawings produced by Lee Mullican in 1945-46 while he was still serving in the Army. Mullican’s time in the army landed him in Japan just after the bombs had dropped, the trauma of what he witnessed never left his work despite its sublimation into deeper and deeper abstraction and automatic processes. Like much of the work in the exhibition, these drawings are a physical actualization of Mullican’s broader intention to see more deeply into the body. \r\n\r\nWorks by David Altmejd, Tabaimo, and Mernet Larsen manifest the volatility of the psyche through unnatural images of the human body. Altmejd has long probed the head as a site of uncanny potential because the head contains everything; the universe, consciousness, and thought itself. His works equally explore what lies within as what exists without, dissolving distinctions between exquisite beauty and horror.Tabaimo’s quasi plant/organ drawings, like her videos, probe an unsettling morphology intent on drawing out themes of isolation and contagion that lurk beneath the daily existence of contemporary Japan. Mernet Larsen’s The Philosophers, produced in 1984, began as an assignment for her students to depict the inner-workings of other people’s minds. The suite of paintings on paper reveal her interest in psychology and philosophy alongside a persistent willingness to probe less tangible aspects of our humanity. \r\n \r\nFred Tomaselli and Trenton Doyle Hancock explore the body in altered states of being and seeing in paintings made from layers of imagery. Tomaselli’s anatomical portrait of a man, Behind Your Eyes (1992), is made from a cocktail of over-the-counter pills such as Tylenol, Advil, Tums, and placebos which are set in paint and resin on wood and presents the body as both a depository of the chemicals it consumes and a visualization of their chemical effect. Hancock’s work Forcicle (1999) made of collaged felt depicts the dream state of a “Mound”, the central and highly stylized character of his constructed universe. By accessing a deep space within his own narrative, Hancock untethers himself from the constraints of our own world and compounds the seductions of unreality. \r\n \r\nWorks by Jon Rafman and Omer Fast weave fiction within political and social realities. Rafman’s video installation Poor Magic, presented in self-contained solo viewing environment, is a mixture of body horror and existential probing, inhabiting a technological nightmare that examines the darker side of the human experience through fantastic digital reconstructions. Fast interests himself in the telling and retelling of stories. His work CNN Concatenated (2002) is composed entirely of excerpts from CNN news anchors. The extracts are edited so that each presenter speaks only a single word, but collectively their words form seven short monologues, suggesting emotive personal appeals rather than conventional news broadcasts. The viewer is left with the impression that these soliloquies are the “real” broadcast, reaching out to us through a porous meeting of worlds and readily apparent if only we listened closely enough.\r\n "

          "LMAKgallery presents its summer group show Vagary of Abstraction, with the works of Rachel Beach, Lisa Beck, Nate Ethier and Dan Walsh. Playing on the notions of the unexpected and inexplicable change, this exhibit looks at abstraction through this filter and jostles the usual expectation of the term. Having four forces of independent image making, these artists allow for a combination of humor, transcendence, formalism, and quirk to not just twist one’s preconception of abstraction, but to do so with a joy of looking.\r\n\r\nRachel Beach’s practice comes out of sculpture: constructed wood forms with plaster, aluminum and resin elements that relate to the figure, and most recently, photographs of hands painted with analogous forms. Her work has been presented in solo and group exhibitions at institutions and galleries in the United States and Canada including Blackston, NY, the Philbrook Museum, Tulsa, OK; Postmasters, New York, NY; Lennon Weinberg, New York, NY; Mixed Greens, New York, NY; Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Plug In Institute of Contemporary Art and MSVU Art Gallery in Canada and most recently the Visual Art Center of New Jersey in Summit.\r\n\r\nLisa Beck’s work creates a synergy, fusing various mediums and modes, including painting, sculpture and installation, and combining the attributes of those modes to make work that isn’t easily put into one category or another. She integrates the properties of positive and the negative, and organized structure and randomness, which she does not see as opposed, but rather linked and cooperative. The wide range of materials (paint, wood, mylar mirror, metal, plastic, etc) she uses alludes to and contributes to the multiple points of view in her work. Her work has been shown at Galerie Samy Abraham, Paris; Anton Kern Gallery, NY; Circuit, Switzerland; La Salle de Bains, Lyon; Musee de’ L’art Modern, et Contemporain, Geneve; Centre d’art Conemporain Meymac, France; Jack Tilton Gallery, NY; Nature Morte Gallery, NY; American Fine Art, NY; and has been represented by Hudson’s Feature Gallery since its inception.\r\n\r\nNate Ethier draws on traditions of twentieth century formalism and hard-edge abstraction, with flamboyant geometric concepts celebrating both the bucolic and the post-industrial world. He creates compositions that allow for the optical emphasis to alternate and reverberate with unequivocal intensity and grace. The mechanics of Ethier’s paintings function as visual motion machines, being both perpetual and philosophical. Ethier’s work has been shown at Minus Space, NY; Geoffery Young Gallery, MA; Nancy Margois Gallery, NY; The Boiler/Pierogi Gallery, NY; Morgan Lehman Gallery, NY; Boston University Gallery, MA; Georgia Southern Univeristy, GA. Ethier is a recipient of Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program Award and the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Grant.\r\n\r\nDan Walsh has been working from a repertoire of elemental forms, with each painting focusing on particular concentric shapes, repeated or nested motifs, optical effects created by the overlay of translucent color strokes, and modulated color fields. The series on view, Cycle, translates specific referents into Walsh’s own playful, yet rigorous visual language. Walsh’s work is in public collections around the world, including the Fonds National d’Art Contemporain, Paris; MAMCO, Geneva; the MoMA, New York; the RISD Museum, Providence; and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He has been exhibited at MoMA’s P.S.1, the New Museum, NY, the Centre National d’Art Contemporain in Nice, la Synagogue de Delme, France, CCNOA (Art + Architecture) in Brussels, and the Kunstverein Medienturm, Graz and MAMCO, Geneva."

          "McKenzie Fine Art presents its summer group exhibition, Translucent.  The exhibition features painting, sculpture and photographs by the following artists: Andrea Belag, Michelle Benoit, Freddy Chandra, Christopher Dunlap, James Lecce, Shane McAdams, Doreen McCarthy, Maureen McQuillan, Shari Mendelson, Pipo Nguyen-duy, Erin O’Keefe, Fran O’Neill, Rob de Oude, Gary Petersen, Don Voisine, and Laura Sharp Wilson.\r\n\r\nThis summer’s group exhibition examines how artists exploit the inherent nature of materials to achieve translucency in their work. Andrea Belag works in oil, applying layers of saturated and intense color with wide brushes to create a fluidly rhythmic and structured composition.  Don Voisine’s multiple layers of matte and glossy ultramarine blue oil paint are applied within a reductive geometric format, giving the illusion of endless space.  Rob de Oude weaves multiple lines of oil color, creating Op-like pulsations and a translucent center.  Using her arms and hands, Fran O’Neill applies her oil paint in muscular swooping strokes of jewel-like colors, while James Lecce pours and pools contrasting translucent and opaque layers of acrylic polymer emulsion to create pulsing and flowing imagery.  Also working with acrylic polymer, Maureen McQuillan intersperses undulating white ink lines with pure ink colors to create great depth and unexpected color combinations that emerge from multiple layers of color on a clear medium.  Shane McAdams creates rich veils of color with distinct linear edges in his abstractions by combining blown ballpoint ink with heated clear resins.\r\n \r\nIn Christopher Dunlap’s painting, layered translucent geometries frame an opaque and patterned center, creating an overall architectonic vista.  Also referencing architectural space are Erin O’Keefe’s set-up photographs, which exploit translucent panels and reflected light to create environments that play with visual perception.  Shari Mendelson’s vessels recall classical glass vase forms from antiquity, but are created from that most ubiquitous of modern materials, recycled plastic bottles, which are painted with  acrylic.  In Doreen McCarthy’s lively sculpture of multi-sized, colored Plexiglas triangles, the passage of light through the surfaces and multi-hued shadows and reflections give the illusion of volumetric space continuing beyond the forms.   Gary Petersen creates interacting zones of space using a translucent veil of white acrylic between playful and irregular geometric fore- and background areas.  \r\n \r\nIn Freddy Chandra’s painting/sculpture hybrids, acrylic and urethane paints on cast rectangular acrylic panels create rhythmic and luminous color sequences.  Michelle Benoit’s small-scaled and softly-colored cast and layered Lucite panels evoke for the artist past events, memories, and a sense of place.  Imparting a psychological weight to her idiosyncratic landscape, Laura Sharp Wilson renders heavy, over-scaled translucent chains draped and crisscrossed over her composition.  In an intentional reversal of a colonial expedition, Vietnamese émigré Pipo Nguyen-duy recorded botanical samples gathered from Monet’s gardens at Giverny in intensely-hued cyanotypes, rendering the plant forms ghostly and immaterial through his process."

        "Description": [
          "In his essay In Praise of Earnestness Clay Matlin writes the following about Liz Ainslie’s paintings:\r\n\r\n“Earnestness is hard. It is troubling, off-putting even, because it makes those who are suspicious of it suspicious of their own feelings. Earnestness requires a suspension of the surety that our contemporary culture gets from ironic detachment. To be earnest is to believe that things matter, that there are things worth believing in. It is a weapon against the creeping nihilism that greets us everywhere in 2017.  \r\n\r\nThis is not to argue, however, that Ainslie’s paintings are aching with sincerity. Nor are they saccharine, or kitsch. Kitsch is not earnest feeling, but, as Clement Greenberg taught us, the simulacrum of earnestness. It is feeling without the risk feeling entails. Ainslie’s paintings, in contrast, are authentic and humane. They are not sweet and easy. They can be difficult, even aggressive in their abstraction, leaving the viewer with little illusion of depth, the space of her images hard to read. Her earnestness resides not in how the work reach out to us to connect, for it does nothing of the sort, but as a testament to Ainslie’s unwavering commitment to abstraction. She neither brings in hints of the world of experience, nor tries to tell us a story. Instead, Ainslie, reluctant heir to 1940’s–high modernism, believes, as Greenberg did, that the painting itself—how it is painted, the way the paint sits on the canvas, how it becomes and embraces its objectness—is the subject matter. This is not to say we look into the painting to find meaning. Rather, the painting reveals meaning to us in our experience of it. This is an old-fashioned, perhaps even outdated, idea. Yet it takes courage to believe earnestly in the power of paint to communicate meaning.”\r\n\r\n“… Ainslie’s paintings are a deliberate attempt to find something to believe in. Ainslie accepts what she calls the “futility in trying to make something new.” She chooses not to lash out at this reality—as so much of post-modernism is an assault on the cruelty of our own lack of originality—but receives the truth of this limitation as a moment to believe that each “mark you make or video you shoot or performance you do is actually taking place in its own moment. The moment is all you can really own.” In believing the act of painting is a deliberate move to claim a moment for oneself, Ainslie does the difficult work of trying to make the experience of painting—the doing and the observing—a fully realized act. In essence, she is trying to share with the viewer the same experience she had when she made her own painting, what Barnett Newman saw as the shared communication of “a sense of place.”\r\n\r\nLiz Ainslie was born in Schenectady, NY in 1978. She lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. She received an MFA from Tyler School of Art in 2004 and a BFA from Alfred University in 2001. Ainslie has had solo shows at Airplane, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and Creon Gallery in Manhattan. Her work has been included in shows at Station Independent Projects, Lu Magnus, Sla307 and Spazio 522 in Manhattan; Orgy Park, Ground Floor Gallery, Outlet Fine Art, Ventana244, Centotto, Parallel Art Space, Small Black Door, Sardine, Trestle Gallery and A.I.R. gallery in Brooklyn; Valentine in Ridgewood, Queens; Vox Populi and Ice Box Project Space in Philadelphia; BCB Fine Art and Imogen Holloway in upstate New York, and Gallerie Kritiku, Prague, Czech Republic. Her work has been reviewed in Il Giornale Dell’Arte, ArtCal Zine, and The GC Advocate. Interviews with Ainslie can be found on blogs including And Freedom For, Pencil in the Studio, #fffffff Walls, Standard Interview, and Otino Corsano. Her work is included in the Pierogi Flat Files. Ainslie was a member of the faculty at School of the Alternative in 2017, a resident artist at Millay Colony for the Arts in 2011, and Atlantic Center for the Arts in 2006."

          "Casey Kaplan presents Nathan Carter: The Dramastics &amp; The Fascinators.\r\n \r\nIn a fantastical cornucopia of color, form and gesture, Nathan Carter (b. 1970, Dallas, TX) presents an alternate realm that combines the story of a fictional punk rock band with his own studio productions and activities. Together with the introduction of figuration, the artist presents his first film titled The DRAMASTICS Are Loud, debuted at the MCA Denver in the fall of 2016. The video chronicles the adventures of The DRAMASTICS, a punk band made out of paper and wire cutout figures set in dioramas. For his sixth solo show with the gallery, Carter merges the dioramic environs created for the film with wall-based aluminum geometric relief abstractions in the form of Fascinators and an amalgam of textiles, collages, works on paper, and a full-size sound stage.\r\n \r\nIn his own words the artist explains:\r\n \r\nIn the spring of 2014, a surprise first-time occurrence unfolded in my studio: I made a series of drawings depicting human figures. The characters looked like pirates in theatrical scenes. They were wearing long dresses and capes and they had very long wavy hair and carried weapons. I put myself in the drawings; I wore a blue mini dress with red lining, light blue thigh-high tights, and red Pope shoes. I had a handlebar mustache and carried a torch. \r\n \r\nI wanted to activate these figures by giving them a story, so I decided to write and direct a video about a punk rock band who call themselves The DRAMASTICS. The story begins on the roof of the Booker T. Washington High School in Dallas, Texas, where lead vocalist Molly Blowout and her electric guitar-playing friend Crimson Ivy make big plans to start a band, write songs, make posters and costumes, and go on a world tour along with Melancholly (their terminally anxious bass player) and Calamity (a seven-foot tall, foul-mouthed street tough drummer from Detroit Rock City). \r\n \r\nI made sure to listen to voices closer to the ages of the women in the band. I tried to pick up their coded language and made careful notes when I heard someone say something exciting. I spent days walking around the city, listening to music, and occasionally stopping to write down all of the stories and humorous vignettes I could remember about my own experiences trying to make music in a high school band. With the help of a close friend who is an actor and a playwright, my notes on language and anecdotes began to take the form of a script. \r\n \r\nI developed the four band members by constructing ten-inch tall, hand-made figures out of paper, glue, aluminum wire, and paint. I gave each band member a distinct look and personality. Next, I made dioramas using found plywood, plastic, and painted paper background scenes for the characters to inhabit. The dioramas look like places a touring band might visit: a steamy, malodorous rehearsal space, an intimidating recording studio, and various exotic locations to perform live music including the Saigon City Roller Discotek, a High Desert generator party and a full-scale model of Paris, France for the film’s final scene. The DRAMASTICS rival band, the Creamin’ Demons, drive around in a white Ford Econoline creeper van. But the DRAMASTICS hurtle through turbulent outer space onboard a precariously refurbished flying machine. The activity of world-building felt like inventing and playing with punk dolls in their punk dollhouse. The entire process, of improvising and building and recording and filming, was like making a DIY basement recording. All of it looked and sounded immediate, fast, loose, and loud. Meticulous craft took a backseat to enthusiasm. \r\n \r\nAs the production came together, my studio started to fill up with a different, but related group of new objects I call Always Good Looks. These include: life-size paper party dress collages, hand-painted skirts, giant flowing crepe de Chine silk scarves dyed with soft watery wandering colorful forms, squad jackets, piñatas, paper hands with long painted fingernails and brazed brass finger rings, hats, capes, sunshades and most importantly, the Fascinators – enlarged versions of festive headwear, part-hat, part-collage, part-sculpture. The Fascinators are meant to be eye catching, full-color, signal-beacons, flamboyant dancers trying to capture the attention of the types of people who charge me up. I made all the apparel, rings, scarves, paper sunshades and Fascinators with the idea that they are gifts for myself and for my  friends. \r\n \r\nBy the winter of 2016, the accumulation of sculptures, drawings, sets, lights, party dresses, scarves and Fascinators made it physically hard to move around my studio. I was writing and recording the music in one corner and recording the characters’ voices in another. A small group of friends became the film crew. They operated the figures in the dioramas while I moved the camera around. In an unspoken exchange my studio became their dance hall fueled by a steady supply of fresh guacamole, quesadillas, handles of Titos, Parliaments, weed and 50,000 watts of sound system bangers and anthems. It was like a gang of rabid peacocks invaded my studio and started a weekly party leaving their colorful feathers behind and cigarette burns everywhere. The feathers were eventually repurposed for part of the final scene in Paris. \r\n \r\nThere is a part of me in each DRAMASTICS band member. They are like my alter egos, and I invented the DRAMASTICS because for as long as I can remember, I’ve wanted to be in a band with amped-up, angry, dirty, cursing punk rockers made up with bat-wing eyeliner. \r\n \r\nNathan Carter (B. 1970, Dallas, TX) received his BFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1995 and MFA from Yale University School of Art, New Haven in 1999. Carter has exhibited internationally, at institutions such as the MCA Denver, CO (solo) (2016); the Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery, Bristol, UK (2016); Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, Middlesbrough, UK (2015); Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, UK (2014); Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, MO (2013); Blaffer Art Museum, University of Houston, TX (solo) (2012); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, IL (2012); Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach, FL (2011); Museo de Arte Raul Anguiano, Guadalajara, Mexico (solo) (2010); Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, TX (2010); and ArtPace, San Antonio, TX (solo) (2008). The artist’s work is included in the public collections of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, IL; Art Gallery of Toronto, Ontario; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, NY; Miami Art Museum, FL; Tate Modern, London; DA2 Centre of Contemporary Art, Salamanca; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; and CU Art Museum, Boulder, CO. In September, Carter is participating in “Sonic Rebellion: Music as Resistance,” a group exhibition curated by Jens Hoffmann and Carleton Goltz at the MCA Detroit, in collaboration with the Detroit Institute of Art and the Detroit Sound Conservancy. He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. "

          "In developing the concept for this exhibition we were interested in the experience of observation and perception. “Double Down” is a group show featuring fifteen artists whose included works deal with associations of reciprocal relationship, establishing intrinsic dialogues within one, or between multiple complementary and oppositional objects, putting the viewer in a different relationship to the work. Instead of an immediate reaction (dialogue) between the viewer and the artwork, here the viewer, in a sense, becomes witness or voyeur to the relationship.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal aspect of “Double Down” also references corresponding phenomena outside the show, such as the reality we experience today where everything seems highly polarized, in politics especially, where fake news or alternative facts can confuse reason and perception. This was, in part, the germ of the idea for this show. In our current environment there is a sense of, one on side, a double world or a parallel world: double visioning, fracturing, shifting, with a concurrent doubling down of dogmatic statements, alternative reality. This schism of perception and reality creates a sense of unease.\r\n\r\nThe works in this exhibition present multiple perspectives on this idea of reciprocal interaction, from serious to satirical. John O’Connor’s painting “Sophia and Jackson” takes as its subject the most popular female and male baby names in 2014 and imagines different life trajectories for two individuals born on the same day: “Binary lives becoming non-binary incrementally.” Lynn Talbot’s “Double World” takes on the visual shadow world in a painting combining classic still life elements juxtaposed with text suggesting an upside down world. In Jean Blackburn’s “Untitled (chairs)” sculpture two chairs are carved away and begin to merge at the knees, fragments from one have fallen away and are spliced into the other. Imagery in Darina Karpov’s “Slow Dazzle I” is fractured and refracted, creating an expanding and / or collapsing visual field. Jim Torok’s double take-effect, diptych portraits reveal subtle differences in the features of his subjects that escape easy detection as it is only possible to view one at a time, suggesting the shifting qualities in all of us. In the J. Fiber diptych, “He Said, She Said,” husband and wife artist collaborators draw the same caricature revealing nuances of technique and hand. Andrew Ohanesian’s “Slots” are two repurposed Double Diamond Slot Machines encouraging the viewer / participant to deposit money and take a spin. A winning ticket is worth the dollar amount printed on its face but is not redeemable for said amount. And in Jane Dickson’s painting, “Wheel of Fortune,” a row of people sit mesmerized by the spinning of lottery wheels before them, seemingly frozen in place, doubling down, and incapable of stepping away."

          "Smack Mellon presents the second Race and Revolution exhibition in a series that utilizes a combination of contemporary artworks and historical documents as a platform to examine patterns of systemic racism in the United States. This edition, entitled Race and Revolution: Still Separate - Still Unequal, investigates the prevalence of segregation in the United States public school system. \r\n\r\n\r\nSince the inception of #BlackLivesMatter in 2012, the American population is reflecting on what happened after the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-60s. That word “after” is part of the conundrum that surrounds our present-day conversation around race and racism. What exactly came to an end? The exhibition Still Separate - Still Unequal seeks to examine ongoing racial and economic disparity in the U.S. public school system. Reports in 2014, the year that marked the sixtieth anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Brown V. Board of Education decision declaring segregated schools as unconstitutional, showed an increase in school segregation. How has this happened, and how can we use art to push the conversation into the public discourse in a new and provocative way?\r\n\r\nThe practice of segregating students by class, race, and “aptitude” in the interest of creating a “better” learning environment has produced a systemic crisis that reverberates within the education system across the United States. Results include the preponderance of controversial policies that adversely impact students and teachers. This summer, eighteen artists, many of whom teach in New York City public schools, offer their perspectives on the enduring legacy of racial and economic school segregation in the United States. \r\n\r\nEVENTS:\r\n\r\nSaturday, June 24, 7pm Kayla Muldrow: A poetry performance exploring freedom, mental bondage, and her first-hand experience in the high school system as a creative individual.\r\n\r\nThursday, June 29, 6-8pm School Segregation: A roundtable discussion with Kyle Spencer and NYC Public School Educators investigating the current climate of school segregation and exploring solutions for systemic change.\r\n\r\nWednesday, July 19, 6-8pm Restorative Justice: An interactive workshop with The Morningside Center for Teaching and Social Responsibility equipping all stakeholders in the community with tools necessary for transforming relationships between students and authority. \r\n\r\nWednesday, July 26, 6-8pm Teaching Artist Roundtable: A discussion with Michael Paul Britto, Uraline Hager, Clare Kambhu, jc lenochan, Shaun Leonardo, and Kameelah Janan Rasheed reflecting on how their experience in the classroom informs their practice and their practice informs their teaching.\r\n\r\nThursday, August 3, 7-9pm Rap on Race with Rice: An interactive performance with Dominique Duroseau inviting participants to separate black and white rice from each other as they discuss issues of race and racism.\r\n\r\nSaturday, August 5, 12-2pm Open Book Test: An engaging performance with Dennis Redmoon Darkeem questioning how much we really know about “American History” and whose narratives are behind our understanding of past in the US.\r\n\r\n\r\nKatie Fuller was an educator for eleven years before curating her first show, Race and Revolution: Exploring Human Injustices through Art, in the summer/fall of 2016. As a high school English teacher, she taught literature through the lens of historical events. While working in education at the New York Historical Society, she wrote curriculum and taught classes on civil liberties and the Fourth Amendment. Always passionate about social justice issues, she felt a pressing need to examine historical memory around race and racism in the United States. These experiences have led her to this specific path - curating the less known and often unspoken histories of systemic racism in the United States by pairing contemporary art with historical narratives. She has applied all she’s learned and continues to learn and challenge people’s perspectives in regards to history and social justice.\r\n\r\nRace and Revolution: Exploring Human Injustices through Art looked at the exploitation of African, African-American, and Native peoples during the American Revolution. The show was reviewed in Hyperallergic and ArtForum and traveled to the UConn: Stamford campus. Race and Revolution: Still Separate – Still Unequal explores school segregation and inequalities. She has another project that just launched and will be ongoing through 2017 titled Unbroken by Bars. It examines the stories of mothers who gave birth while incarcerated, a topic influenced by Michelle Alexander’s book The New Jim Crow and the endless fight for women’s rights.\r\n\r\nIG: @RaceandRevolution\r\nhttp://www.racerevolution.org/ \r\n\r\nLarry Ossei-Mensah is a Ghanaian-American independent curator and cultural critic who has documented contemporary art happenings for various publications including NeueJournal, Uptown and Whitewall Magazine. His writings have profiled some of the most dynamic visual artists working today—Derrick Adams, Mickalene Thomas, Kehinde Wiley, Lorna Simpson and street artist JR. As a curator, Ossei-Mensah uses contemporary art and culture as a vehicle to redefine how we see ourselves and the world around us. He has organized exhibitions at commercial and nonprofit galleries throughout New York City featuring a roster of critically acclaimed artists including Firelei Baez, ruby amanze, Hugo McCloud, Brendan Fernandes, and Derek Fordjour to name a few. \r\n\r\nOssei-Mensah is also the Co-Founder of ARTNOIR, a global collective of culturalists who design multimodal experiences aimed to engage this generation’s dynamic and diverse creative class. ARTNOIR serves as a tangible extension of Ossei-Mensah’s curatorial vision of “bridging gaps.” ARTNOIR’s inaugural event was a conversation on art and gender justice featuring Wangechi Mutu, Julie Mehretu and Adrienne Edwards.\r\n\r\nRecently, Ossei-Mensah has been named the 2017 Critic-in Residence at ART OMI in addition to serving as Co-Chair on Russell Simmons’ RUSH Artist Advisory Board and on the MoMA Friends’s of Education Board.\r\n"

          "NO NEW FORMS, a multi-sensory and collaborative installation by MATERIAL GIRLS explores the stairwell as a transitional space through water related imagery and the ways water corresponds to psychological states. The stairwell will contain three “environments” that flow into one another, calling upon the different phases of water to mark the progression of the viewer through the space on several axes: from low to high, from outside to inside, from natural to artificial, etc. MATERIAL GIRLS is a nonlocal collective of female-identifying sculptors formed in 2016. Through a range of mediums the collective combines corporate aesthetics and camp to explore the illusion of materiality in our digital age and contemporary feminism. MATERIAL GIRLS have exhibited at Spring/Break Art Show 2017 and Spring/Break BKLYN IMMERSIVE. "

        "Description": [
          "Hauser &amp; Wirth presents an exhibition devoted to the work of Belgian artist Philippe Vandenberg (1952 – 2009). Curated by Anthony Huberman, director of the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Art, San Francisco, the exhibition features more than 150 paintings and works on paper completed in the last years of the artist’s life. Unwavering in his willingness to explore even the most extreme dichotomies of human experience, Vandenberg employed a distinctive approach to gesture, color, text, and form. The result is a body of work of raw urgency that provokes a range of complex emotional responses.\r\n\r\n.The exhibition is accompanied by a new illustrated publication spanning the entirety of Vandenberg’s career and featuring essays by David Anfam and Wouter Davidts; Philippe Vandenberg’s last interview, with Ronny Delrue; and a transcribed discussion on Vandenberg’s work with scholars including Jo Applin (Courtauld Institute of Art, London), Anna Dezeuze (École supérieure d’art et de design Marseille-Méditerranée), Maarten Liefooghe (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels), Raphäel Pirenne (erg, La Cambre, Brussels), Merel van Tilburg (University of Geneva), and John C. Welchman (University of California, San Diego).\r\n\r\nA significant figure in contemporary art in Belgium, Vandenberg rose to international prominence in the 1980s with works that combined personal narratives with literary, art historical, and philosophical references. Teeming with images, symbols, and words that touch upon themes of war, religion, sexuality, and death, his oeuvre includes a staggering range of motifs and techniques; it is filled with haunting narratives, lively abstractions, and cryptic fragments of language. Central to the continual experimentation and stylistic shifts that characterize Vandenberg’s diverse body of work is his self-described ‘kamikaze’ attitude: a firm belief in destruction as the prerequisite for creation.\r\n\r\nUnfolding across three gallery floors, the exhibition traces the approaches and images that characterized Vandenberg’s last years. Paintings and drawings made between 2006 and 2009 explore his increasingly obsessive investigations into the tensions between language and abstraction, words and wordlessness. Introducing this theme is ‘No title’ (2009), in which Vandenberg scrawled the words ‘a man says nothing, he paints’ in colored pastel on the surface of the page, asserting the contradiction between the use of language and the limitations of what language can convey. In many of Vandenberg’s later works, words are incorporated as fragments, reading simultaneously as angry declarations and ambiguous incantations. An accomplished draughtsman, the artist relayed these messages with precise yet frenetic line-work that conveys a sense of urgency.\r\n\r\nOften pushing his use of language to an extreme, Vandenberg created hundreds of works on paper saturated with enigmatic words and phrases in French, English, German, and Spanish. In one gallery of the exhibition, a dense grid of drawings becomes a paradoxically resounding and destabilizing force, with simple phrases and words repeating until they become strangely unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nAs part of his studio practice, Vandenberg lled hundreds of sketchbooks with drawings of figures and abstract shapes that repeat in varying geometric patterns and give form to an enigmatic personal iconography. Attributing a therapeutic power to his work, Vandenberg steadfastly believed in the healing effect of his practice: ‘The drawing – the image – will be my language. I must never stop drawing. The drawing will contain the inexpressible and it will protect me. The incantation can begin. The ritual has been born.’\r\n\r\nOn view for the first time in the exhibition at Hauser &amp; Wirth is a complete example of one of Vandenberg’s drawing books, which reveals an intimate, diary-like form of expression. More than one hundred pages of fervent and immediate drawings vacillate between abstraction and representation, revealing an inherent narrative structure, as intricately articulated systems of images accumulate, intersect, morph, and diverge again. Here the viewer sees Vandenberg’s propensity for repetition, a strategy the artist applied throughout his career: ‘Compared to the menacing chaos that unfolded beyond the sheet, [drawing] brought me peace. I still endeavor to nd that sense of security within the structure of the square, and to capture a mystery without giving anything away.’\r\n\r\nIn stark contrast to the immediacy of his works on paper, a selection of Vandenberg’s late monochromatic abstract paintings shows the artist often painting over earlier works, building up layers of images and colors. His annihilation of previous paintings renders surfaces powerful in their physicality, scarred by countless additions and erasures. These works include ‘No Title’ (2008), in which words and images are visible just below a densely textured surface, hinting at past dialogues embalmed within the canvas. Similarly, another untitled painting nearby, ‘No Title’ (2008), incorporates fragments of representational imagery into the otherwise abstract and seemingly blank composition. The dark surface of the canvas is interrupted by the spectral image of a tank—a literal manifestation of the ‘battleground’ that is Vandenberg’s constant negotiation between abstraction and figuration.\r\n\r\nThe motif of the ‘battle’ is explored in more explicit terms in a series of works on paper that depicts boxing gloves, helicopters, and mazes. Works from the series, ‘No title (from the book ‘Le livre le plus long’ / ‘The Longest Book’)’ (2003), feature a text describing the conflict between the mind and the gut, underlining Vandenberg’s enduring struggle to reconcile language with abstraction and acumen with instinct. With these elements resurfacing time and again, Vandenberg’s diverse oeuvre reads as an endless cycle of endings and successive beginnings, where destruction inevitably stimulates creation.\r\n\r\nAbout the Artist\r\n\r\nBelgian Artist Philippe Vandenberg (1952 – 2009) began his studies in literature and art history before turning to painting and graduating from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent, Belgium in 1976.\r\n\r\nAfter several solo and group exhibitions in Europe, Vandenberg exhibited for the rst time in New York in 1986, whereupon the Guggenheim Museum acquired one of his paintings for its collection. At the time, Vandenberg was considered one of the most successful Belgian contemporary artists. Several important solo exhibitions followed, including one in 1995 at the Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst in Ghent (now the S.M.A.K.), in 1999 at the MuHKA – Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst in Antwerp, and in 2006 with ‘L’important c’est le Kamikaze:\r\n\r\nOeuvre 2000 – 2006’ at the Musée Rimbaud in Charleville-Mézières. The De Pont Museum in Tilburg (2012) and the Maison Rouge in Paris (2014) showed works by the artist in dialogue with the Belgian artist Berlinde De Bruyckere. Recent notable exhibitions include a solo presentation at Drawing Room in London (2016), and ‘Live or Die. Philippe Vandenberg and Bruce Nauman’ at Gallery So e Van de Velde in Antwerpen (2017).\r\n"

        "Description": [
          "Almine Rech Gallery New York presents an exhibition of new paintings by Erik Lindman. His first solo exhibition in the city where he lives and works, the show will feature a group of large-scale vertical paintings as well as several smaller works, all of which exemplify his open- ended curiosity about how painting functions at this moment in time. Though his work is notable for its subtlety and its exploration of painting’s constituent parts (including its material supports, pigments, and mediums), Lindman also poses broad questions about why paintings get made and why viewers return to look at them again and again, simultaneously focusing attention on their cultural ramifications and the plain facts of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the works on view feature a central, often monumental form isolated on a monochromatic field. If this figure-ground relationship is a constant, the means by which Lindman establishes it differ radically from one painting to the next. In some cases he scavenges materials like luan or stainless steel from his urban surroundings, affixes them seamlessly to panels, and then applies paint to them. In others he proceeds in a more traditional manner, finding forms through the act of painting and inscribing shapes on linen grounds. The preparation and inherent physical qualities of these various surfaces, and the way paint moves across them, become important factors in the evolution of each composition.\r\n\r\nRather than treat the painting surface as a metaphysically pure, idealized concept, Lindman constantly constructs it anew, calling attention to the fact that surface is not a singular phenomenon but always a coming together of materials (including paint itself) that are made to adhere to one another. He has also recently begun to experiment with grinding his own pigments, creating paints that are less uniform in their consistency than their industrially produced counterparts. Such operations introduce a measure of unpredictability that finds expression in the dynamic and thoughtful mood that defines the finished works, which combine the everyday intimacy of collage with the contemplative gravity of minimalist sculpture.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lindman also recognizes that paintings differ from other kinds of surfaces, and retain specific cultural meaning as perceptually active places where viewers are free to engage visual phenomena on aesthetic terms––an engagement that involves grappling with the basic mystery of what makes something ‘aesthetic’ in the first place. The found materials that sometimes make their way into Lindman’s compositions are therefore carefully integrated so that pre-existing narratives about their prior lives out in the world do not prevent them from being read as two-dimensional elements in a painterly syntax. Like the shapes that emerge from his drawing practice and find their ways into his paintings, these materials are no more––and no less––than examples of the ways in which the artist interacts with his environment, translating his experience of local conditions into forms that engender independent experiences for viewers in other places and at other times.\r\n\r\nFor Lindman, there is therefore no hard distinction between what is found and what is invented. This also applies to the histories of modernism and non-objective painting that inform his work without wholly accounting for its power. Though abstraction has been put to a wide variety of uses in different social and aesthetic contexts, serving as the engine for everything from radical political art to mannerist decoration, it remains possible to consider it as its own category with its own rules, however difficult these might be to define. Lindman orients his work precisely towards this shadowy but intimately familiar place, seeking to channel the animating spirit of a cultural force that can be visceral or cerebral, accessible or rarefied, depending on how––and by whom––it is used. For this reason his paintings are personal documents that directly acknowledge the time and place in which they are made. And while his titles occasionally serve as prompts, pointing toward the memories, observations, or ideas underpinning his imagery, Lindman resists assuming a wholly autobiographical stance. His presence instead serves as a conduit through which each individual viewer is invited to participate in the shared activity of remaking painting, here and now, out of the things that exist around and within us."

          "HG Contemporary and Philippe Hoerle-Guggenheim present a solo exhibition by artist Conor Mccreedy titled “Mccreedyblue,” featuring his textured monochromatic abstract splash and figurative paintings. \r\n\r\nMccreedy cites the landscapes of where he was raised in Southern Africa, with “cobalt skies that meet the powerful Indian and Atlantic oceans, filled with endless shades of blue” as inspiration for his work. A limited edition archival print of his painting “Frozen in Time” on handmade paper will also be featured in the show.\r\n \r\n“Conor produces elegant and powerful works with his signature shade of blue. I’m intrigued by how he explores texture and technique within the context of using a single color while creating a feeling of luxury through the same hue,” said Hoerle-Guggenheim. \r\n \r\nBased in Zurich, Mccreedy has sold out solo exhibitions internationally. He held his first solo exhibition at the National Arts Club, titled “Outliers,” making him the youngest artist to have had a solo exhibition at the venue. By using one color, he focuses on process, technique and material exploration, working to “transcend visionary barriers.” His influences range from Pablo Picasso to Willem de Kooning."

        "Description": [
          "Almine Rech Gallery presents Ghost Studies, an exhibition of new work by Brazilian artist Ana Mazzei (b. 1980, São Paulo).\r\n\r\nFor nearly a decade, Ana Mazzei has been known for her elegant, abstract sculptures, that are presented alone or in groups with a quiet,slightly anthropomorphic presence. Sometimes painted or varnished, and made primary out of wood – a flexible and generic material that appeals to an artist who likes to “make” things by herself in the studio – Mazzei’s standing arrangements of angles, curves and straight lines quote the vocabulary of the avant-garde with a distinctive twist.\r\n\r\nIn Mazzei’s practice, the viewer is never incidental, on the contrary, they are taken into account from the beginning, like a friendly ghost that is always present with the artist while she conceives her work. This spectator is used by Mazzei as a way to materialize her thoughts about space and its relationship to the artwork, “Whenever I start a new project I find myself involved with a repetitive thought that has something to do with my surroundings; I mean the space around me, or around someone else (the spectator).”\r\n\r\nOf course, this viewer-centric way of thinking is also reminiscent of minimalist processes; Donald Judd described the austere characteristics of the minimal work as a way to materialize the external world, or, that what is “not” the work. In Mazzei’s case, however, one might do better to look to the Brazilian vanguard and its empathy towards the object, a craving for a direct feeling. “I remember as a child going to a São Paulo biennial and touching an object from Lygia Clark. So to me, these processes are part of us, of Brazilian art history! I like to touch things” said the artist recently in an interview.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, it is the artwork that suddenly creates a consciousness of the context, and therefore the body, in a vital back and forth for the viewer. In Mazzei’s work, specific attention is paid to the dimensions of the sculpture, whether through the works’ similarity to the scale of the body or playing on perceptions of the minuscule or the gigantic. Speaking on her work Nova Knossos (2013), the artist says, “I was looking to create a relationship where the spectator felt very big, as if she were growing like a giant, and could see cities as small objects.”\r\n\r\nSimilar dynamics are at play within Mazzei’s most recent body of work, which is surprisingly close to resembling traditional painting. Discussing this stylistic shift with the artist, I argued that the trend to call anything that is presented flat on a wall a ‘painting’ is pretty recent. In the 1970s, her graphic marks on fine linen, simply hung on a wooden bar or frame and left to their own atmospheric movement, would probably have been labeled as something else. We agree on the fact that above all, painting alludes to a representative space, whether in an attempt to mimic reality or build an imaginary fiction. Thus, for Mazzei, starting to make these two- dimensional works was instinctive, a simple extension of what she has been doing in her sculptures and preparatory drawings.\r\n\r\nMazzei has created plans for a number of works that have never been produced - for the most part ambitious public sculptures - that simply locate herself and the viewer, in the world, the architecture, and the spaces around us. Here, thin lines demarcate what seem to be floor plans or flattened buildings, while dark, violently applied surfaces of color, that almost seem to mistreat the delicate fabric they are applied to, flash more concrete objects and forms, their sensuality both appealing and crude, almost vulgar, at the same time. There is an immediacy to these works that is striking and uncompromising, and also political. As I was asking her about the need, or possibility, for art to be political within the framework of the extreme current political situation in her country, she elegantly replied, “I am thinking of art as a space of experience, not as a way to use political terms as a trampoline4”. Reflecting on recent debates in New York City about what painting can and can’t do, what it should and shouldn’t represent, and who can or can’t paint and for whom: there is food for thought from the South, with love.\r\n\r\nText by Dorothée Dupuis."

          "In celebration of its fourth anniversary, this summer Planthouse Gallery takes a look back at its history and forward to its future. A group show featuring artists included in exhibitions from the past four years will be presented in the main interior space, with past and recent works providing an archive of a community and an indication of its creative growth. The Say A Little Prayer for U.S. Flag Project will be on view simultaneously in the outdoor garden space.\r\n\r\nFrom its beginning in 2013, Planthouse has acted as a nimble project space, aiming to facilitate col- laboration among artists by mounting two- and three-person shows and thematic exhibitions with larger groups. Its first show, Plus 1, prompted five artists to select a “guest” of their own to join the exhibition, thereby acknowledging the roles of friendship and group networks as major drivers in the art world on both the production and consumption ends. Collaborative exhibitions at Planthouse have also taken other forms: a pair who know each other well, like Grayson Cox and Nadja Frank (Self Checkout, 2015), a collective like SuttonBeresCuller (Solid Gold, 2013–14), and two artists unknown to each other, put together to forge new connections, like Victoria Burge and Naho Taruishi (2017).\r\n\r\nThe publishing arm of the gallery will also be chronicled in the display of print editions it has released since its founding, including projects with Philip Taaffe and Chuck Webster. The gallery has often published new editions with exhibiting artists before, during and after their shows, like the portfolio made by Glen Baldridge, Ian Cooper and David Kennedy Cutler for their 2014 show, Thousand Year Old Child, and the port- folio by Louise Eastman and Heather Watkins that resulted from their 2016 show, Reservoir. In addition, Four More Years will include new publications, Neon, an anniversary silkscreen featuring the gallery’s cactus and sun logo as well as a new print edition by Richard Dupont. The collaborative nature of printmaking underpins Planthouse’s philosophy, and the desire to not only showcase emerging artists, but also create new works with them, driving its publishing activity."

          "The International Studio &amp; Curatorial Program announces A City Called Mirage, an exhibition by Kiluanji Kia Henda, current resident at ISCP. The artist’s first solo exhibition in the United States, A City Called Mirage looks at real cities and their 3D models in an immersive four-channel video installation, as well as three intercon- nected series of photographs.\r\n\r\nIn A City Called Mirage, Henda considers\r\nthe birth, life and death of modern cities.\r\nThe exhibition begins with a photograph of\r\na rusty time-worn sign of the word “Mira-\r\ngem” (Mirage), found by the artist in the\r\n\r\nNamib Desert. Acting as a catalyst for new work that contemplates humanity’s drive towards urban- ization, the sign spurred Henda to look at Dubai as the faulty archetype of the contemporary city, as the byproduct of neoliberal desires. New cities such as Dubai are often built with little consideration of their historic context or environmental impacts, drawing parallels to the urban reconstruction of the artist’s home city Luanda, Angola.\r\n\r\nIn Paradise Metalic (2014), four synchronized videos together recount the construction of an ideal city, dreamt by the “Man with the Shovel” and built on the barren Maliha Desert in Sharjah. At once land art and performance, a new fictional country is established and subsequently demolished in the sand, hauntingly demarcated by stakes in the ground, concrete walls and iron skeletons of buildings. Based on traditional Central African sona sand drawings, A City Called Mirage (2013–17)—a series of 50 photographs, also the title of the ISCP exhibition—documents large-scale sculptures assembled in the desert, based on the silhouettes of an imaginary city, using the geometric forms of sona drawings as a blueprint. Native to Tchokwe culture of Eastern Angola, these ephemeral forms are drawn in the sand to tell stories and transmit oral histories. Dubai as a spectacular city and the ultimate tabula rasa is conjured in How to Create You Own Personal Dubai at Home (2013), with playful instructions for how to build your own iconic skylines at home using everyday domestic materials such as old circuit boards, tinfoil, beer cans and match sticks.\r\n\r\nKiluanji Kia Henda (born 1979, Luanda, Angola) is a Luanda-based artist , working across photogra- phy, video and performance. He has had exhibitions at institutions including SCAD Museum, Savan- nah, 2016; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, 2016; National Museum of African Art – Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., 2015; Tamayo Museum, Mexico, 2012; and Arnolfini, Bristol, 2012. He participated in the 2015 Triennial: Surround Audience, New Museum, New York; Dakar Biennale, 2014; Bienal de São Paulo, 2007; and the Venice Biennale, 2007. He is winner of 2017 Frieze Artist Award and the 2012 National Prize of Art and Culture, awarded by the Ministry of Culture, Luanda.\r\nThis exhibition is curated by Kari Conte, Director of Programs and Exhibitions.\r\n"

          "Van Doren Waxter presents Cameron Martin: Reticulations, an exhibition debuting contemporary artist Cameron Martin’s new body of small-scale, optical drawings. Reticulations is the first solo show of Martin’s work in New York in six years.\r\n\r\nThe drawings in Martin’s Reticulations were made over a period of three years using permanent marker on paper, representing a radical departure from the artist’s 15-year practice of large-format landscape-based painting. Deviating from the issues of representation foregrounded in his dark gray and black photo-based paintings of the mid to late 2000s and the illusory, nearly white-on-white work from his subsequent Bracket series, the lush, saturated colors and purely abstract nature of this newest body of work mark a definitive turn in Martin’s production. At the same time, while the visual content of Reticulations is entirely new, the series reflects an insistent focus on perception, exactitude, and inscrutability that has been present throughout the artist’s career.\r\n\r\nAs the exhibition’s title suggests, each work in Reticulations is composed of intersecting lines that conjure networks both material and virtual. Distributions of vibrant, gradient-like fields of color appear to be illuminated from within, evoking sonic textures, textile patterning and imagined information space. The procedures used to produce the drawings are both systematic and aleatory, creating periodic disruptions to the overall stability of the image, reminiscent of the technological glitch. The resulting compositions provide a platform for studious examination of the activity of visual perception and consumption.\r\n\r\nCoinciding with Reticulations is a solo exhibition of Martin’s new body of paintings at the University Art Museum at SUNY Albany entitled Abstracts. Produced in conjunction with Abstracts is a fully illustrated catalogue with an essay by art historian and critic Suzanne Hudson.\r\n\r\nCameron Martin was born in Seattle, Washington in 1970 and lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He was educated at Brown University and the Whitney Independent Study Program. He is the recipient of a 2010 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship and a 2008 Joan Mitchell Foundation Fellowship, among other awards. Solo exhibitions include James Harris Gallery, Seattle, WA (2017), Galerie Nikolaus Ruzicska, Salzurg, Austria (2016), Bracket, Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, New York, NY (2011), Gallery Min Min in Tokyo (2008) and Currents 97: Cameron Martin, at the St Louis Art Museum, St Louis, MO (2006). His work has been presented in group exhibitions internationally, including Mythos Berg, RLB Kunstbrücke, Innsbruck, Austria (2011), roundabout, City Gallery, Wellington, New Zealand, which travelled to the Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, Israel (2010), and the prestigious Whitney Biennial (2004). His work is in numerous museum collections, including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Seattle Art Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others."

          "MARIANNE BOESKY GALLERY presents Cells, a group exhibition featuring works by Matthias Bitzer, Jackie Brookner, Alex Da Corte, the Haas Brothers, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Jennie C. Jones, Nancy Lupo, Jorge Pardo, and Cosima von Bonin. Taken loosely from Louise Bourgeois’ renowned series of psychologically rich environments, the exhibition features artists who expose the tensions between functionality and aesthetics. \r\nA range of minimal, psychedelic, political, historical and humorous perspectives will be explored in service of a common poetry. Just as a poem is woven from words to evoke emotions or spawn new, incommunicable concepts in the mind of a reader, so may an object or image manipulate a viewer’s experience through thoughtful use of materials, composition, and context.\r\n \r\nEach artist in Cells skillfully employs forms and media laden with assumptions and associations ready to be overturned. Jackie Brookner’s packed earth and velvet chairs, Jessica Jackson Hutchins’ papier-mache-encrusted couch, and the Haas Brothers’ undulating walnut table seduce the viewer with a familiar history but their presence within a gallery and ambiguous function subvert the meaning and purpose of these objects.\r\n \r\nIn addition to the politics of the domestic, the consumption of space within the gallery is also a trope to upend. Alex Da Corte’s evocative velvet curtain winds through the exhibition, the artist’s coat of arms proclaims icons of his own artwork and invades the space while concurrently delineating it. Nancy Lupo’s casts of ice trays punctuate the quieter moments in the gallery’s architecture, highlighting the environment in which they’re installed and commenting on the nature of presentation. And the abstract Acoustic Paintings by Jennie C. Jones invite investigation of the corners and edges of the compositions as well as the exhibition space itself. Upon closer inspection these seemingly minimal paintings reveal themselves to be made of acoustic panels—further complicating their interaction within the gallery and setting off a multisensory, layered reading. \r\n \r\nDrawing on the memories, feelings and preconceptions of the viewer, each piece in this exhibition makes its own leap from definable object to nonverbal metaphor—discarding traditionally accepted hierarchies of art, design and craft in the process.\r\n\r\n[Image: (left) The Haas Brothers.

          "James Fuentes presents its solo exhibition with Devon Dikeou.\r\n\r\nSeating at galleries, museums, and art fairs is always a conundrum. Gallerists, museum curators, and art booth proprietors either lack chairs to sit on, curate seating within their environments, rent chairs for their booths, and/or sell the chairs they use. There is rarely a place for the tired art-goer to settle for long, and because of this lack of seating in galleries, much less in antique establishments, museum period rooms, or antique fairs-one might mistakenly sit on a treasure, or worse, be silently admonished by tasteful placards displayed with phrases such as: Please Refrain from Sitting on Furniture, Do Not Touch, or simply an elegant ribbon tied from arm to arm. \r\n\r\n“Pray For Me”-Pope Francis I is an installation in the form of ten 17th century Italian “monk” chairs, which function as random seating throughout the art gallery. These chairs were originally called friarlero-meaning “brothers”-due to their use by monks or higher religious actuary, even Popes. Each chair in the installation is named after an historical painting of a Pope: Raphael’s Julius II and Leo X, Sebastiano del Piombo’s Clement VII, Titian’s Paul III (twice) and Sixtus IV, El Greco’ s Pius V, Caravaggio’ s Paul V, Velázquez’s Innocent X, and Jacques Louis David’s Pius VII. Each chair has been individually photographed and positioned according to the respective painting, but without the seated subject-the absence of which conjures Papal ghosts. The friarleros are all tagged with price tags alluding to their commercial value as antiques. Yet these are marked not with a price, but with the name of the painter and that of the Pope who ostensibly would sit in the chair represented. The photographic portraits of the chairs appropriate and cite the place of monetary and art historical value in real and literal terms by the photographs being reproduced to the sizes of their inspiration. Additionally, the installation features a reliquary housing “relics” shed by the chairs over the course of their lives as artworks in the artist s’ possession. As the chairs lose these fragments of fabric, the artist will add them to the reliquary in another nod to the practices of the Catholic Church. So while the reliquary steadily grows and relics accumulate, the photos and chairs, with nothing in them, serve as backdrop-the negative space that defines what is there and not. In their emptiness, the images and chairs dismantle and play on ideas of portraiture, patronage, politics, art history, and memorial. \r\n\r\nDevon Dikeou (b. 1963, Denver, CO) lives and works in Austin, TX. Recent solo exhibitions include “Please,” Outcasts Incorporated, Paris (2015); “Between the Acts: Virginia Woolf,” Nada Art Fair, Miami (2014); “Pray For Me,” Nada Art Fair, New York City (2014); and “Please”, The Contemporary, Austin (2013). Recent group exhibitions include “Group Exhibition,” James Fuentes LLC, New York City (2017); “Foundation Barbin Presents Redeux (Sort of),” Kai Matsumiya, New York City (2016); “Inhabiting Ten Eyck,” Storefront Ten Eyck, New York City (2014); and “Game Changer,” Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Boulder, CO (2014). Devon Dikeou is the founder, editor and publisher of zingmagazine, and a co-founder of The Dikeou Collection in Downtown Denver. \r\n\r\n[Image: Left: Caravaggio, Portrait of Pope Paul V, oil on canvas, 80 in x 47 in, c. 1605-1606\r\nRight: Devon Dikeou, “Pray For Me”-Pope Francis I: Caravaggio, Portrait of Pope Paul V, mounted C-print, 80 in x 47 in, 2014}\r\n "

Additional panelists included Abrons staff: Jay Wegman (Artistic Director), Carolyn Sickles (Director of Engagement) and Joshua Lubin-Levy (Interim Director of Visual Arts). The application pool was extremely competitive and revealed a wealth of talented artists in need of vital workspace and support. Abrons staff and guest panelists were encouraged by the energy and breadth of ideas demonstrated within the applications and would like to express sincere gratitude to all artists and curators who applied.\r\n\r\nKRISTEN JENSEN\r\n\r\nKristen Jensen has an interdisciplinary art practice, involving sculpture, painting, performance, and installation. Ritual and the questioning of the line that exists between strength and weakness, control and disorder finds material form in the ceramic and mixed media objects that are part of her practice. The work contrasts beauty with destruction, and intimate, emotional explorations with formal investigations of material and media. She received her MFA in combined media from Hunter College and her BFA in printmaking from Syracuse University. Recent exhibits in New York City include those at Regina Rex, Postmasters, Wallspace, and Outlet. Her work has also been shown at Bortolami Gallery, Nicelle Beachene, Sculpture Center, Bureau, Galerist (Istanbul), and Sundaram Tagore Gallery (as part of the Singapore Biennial). Upcoming residencies include the Shandaken Project and the Abrons AIRspace Residency. [website]\r\n\r\nSARA JORDENÖ\r\n\r\nSara Jordenö is a NYC -based Swedish visual artist, documentary filmmaker and researcher, whose work resides in the crossing points of site-specific and public art, documentary cinema, and community-based participatory performative practice. Jordenö’s longitudinal projects often engage with hidden populations and communities facing marginalization, creating complex portraits of struggle and resilience. In the process of making these works, she has collaborated with (and at times shared authorship with) sociologists, activists, community organizers and members of the communities that she investigates. Her documentary KIKI, a collaboration with members of the underground Kiki Ballroom scene, a subculture for LGBTQ at-risk youth in NYC, premiered in competition at Sundance Film Festival in 2016. Jordenö was awarded the Teddy Award for Best Documentary Film and the Kathleen Bryan Edwards Award for Human Rights for KIKI, which has screened in 15 countries. Jordenö holds an MFA from UCLA Department of Art and has for the past 16 years participated in many residencies and exhibited internationally. Her work has been commissioned by the Public Art Agency Sweden, Gothenburg International Biennial of Contemporary Art, Printed Matter, Muscarnok Kunsthalle and the 5th Berlin Biennial. In June 2016 she was named by Variety as one of “10 Women Filmmakers to Watch.” [website]\r\n\r\nBASEERA KHAN\r\n\r\nBaseera Khan is a New York based artist. Her visual and written work focuses on performing visualized patterns of emigration and exile that are shaped by economic, social, and political changes throughout the world with a special interest in decolonization practices. Khan is preparing for her first solo exhibition at Participant Inc., New York City (2017). Her past exhibitions include: “Subject to Capital” Abrons Art Center, New York City (2016); “Arrivals” Out to See, New York City (2014); “TX*13” Texas Biennial 5th Anniversary Survey Group Exhibition, Texas (2014); “Picturing Parallax” San Francisco State University, California (2011); and “Hindu Kush” Hosfelt Gallery, San Francisco, California (2009).

          "Petzel Gallery SomeBodies, a summer group exhibition featuring the sculptural work of the following six artists:\r\n\r\nKeith Edmier\r\nMedea, 2016\r\nIn his new sculpture Keith Edmier approaches the Ancient Greek myth of Medea. The sculpture, cast in pink dental stone, shows Medea rising from deceased Los Angeles artist Lowell Grant’s kiln, holding her child on her lap, preparing to slay him. The sculpture takes its initial form from a 19th Century sculpture by Yannoulis Chalepas, who spent most of his life in an insane asylum. Medea is portrayed by Nancy Kovack, the actress who played Medea in the 1963 Hollywood version of Jason and the Argonauts, a movie that influenced Keith’s early childhood. Lowell Grant sculpted a portrait of Nancy Kovack, who played an artist’s model, in the Vincent Price movie, Diary of a Madman, also from 1963. Grant died tragically when his kiln exploded in 1977. The kiln still exists as a ruin on the actual site. Mythological Greek tragedy conflates with real life tragedy.\r\n\r\nGeorg Herold\r\nBrown Betelgeuze, 1989\r\nBetelgeuze, the brightest star in the constellation of Orion, is used as the source for Herold’s bronze sculpture, as the star is not only brown, but it is also an irregular, elongated structure. The sculpture sits upon a white cuboid form, which is two things at once: a formal antithesis and a pedestal. This sculpture and comparable works by the artist provide an ironic commentary on the heated discussion raging in the 1980s about floor sculptures without pedestals.\r\n\r\nSean Landers\r\nPan, 2006\r\nSculpted in wet clay and exhibited underneath the New York City High Line train trestle, Pan was exposed to the elements, for one month in the spring of 2006. On the last day of the exhibition, Pan was brought to a foundry to be cast into bronze. The work embodies the sculptural sensibilities and iconography of Sean Landers, who has used the Greek half-god Pan in painting and sculpture since 1991. Pan’s goatish image recalls conventional depictions of Satan, while his name is associated with the concept of an all-encompassing entity. The name of this Greek god of the wild, nature, and shepherds, is the origin of the word “panic”, the cause of the sudden fear that sometimes comes for no reason, especially in lonely places.\r\n\r\nJon Pylypchuk\r\nallright, i guess i can’t be sincere to you anymore, 2015\r\n“It’s a Pietà. You think you are going to save the world but instead you get old and have kids. And you think your kids are going to save the world. But they will get old and have kids” (Jon Pylypchuk).\r\n\r\nNicola Tyson\r\nDancing Figure #1, Dancing Figure #2, 2016\r\nNicola Tyson’s new figurative sculptures, from the series Firewood Sculptures, are made by piecing together dried, chopped up firewood. Tyson minimally carves the wood, stripping the bark and carving out the interior, yet preserves the natural knots and holes on the exterior. The artist constructs each figure with sections of apple, elm and maple woods, fitting them together to create a continuous body in space—finding twisted pieces that stand in for heads and hands. The act of building can be seen to be parallel to her drawing; the artist intuitively finds and creates the figure through the process of making it.\r\n\r\nHeimo Zobernig\r\nUntitled, 2015\r\nThe model for this bronze sculpture is assembled from 3-D scans of parts of three sculptures: the head and facial cast of a figure exhibited at Galerie Chantal Crousel in Paris (2008), the androgynously modeled crotch area of the shelf sculpture exhibited at Simon Lee Gallery in London (2009), and the legs, chest and upturned arms of a figure from 2012. The individual parts are digitally cut together in rough sections to produce a classical “contrapposto” position."

          "Sharing everyday life, meals and ideas can form deep, lasting bonds among a class of aspiring artists earning a Master of Fine Arts degree. When artists recommend, nominate or curate a fellow artist, they strengthen that bond — in quiet, personal moments generosity often prevails over artistic envy.\r\n\r\n1969 presents Close Quarters an exhibition of over twenty paintings by artists who went to school in New Haven, curated by Toronto-born painter Keiran Brennan Hinton (Yale, ‘16). Brennan Hinton invited the participants and limited his curatorial decision-making to works never-before exhibited, the commission of new works, and “…works I admired and remembered after studio visits, especially pieces that came out from hiding because of an intuitive trust among artists.”\r\n\r\nCurrently working and living in New York City, Brennan Hinton had a recent debut solo exhibition (Matter of Fact Mulherin, New York) that functioned as a de facto school reunion. Paintings of Brennan Hinton’s studio, a complex of sheetrock walls he helped to build and now shares with eight other artists, and zoom-in/zoom-out paintings of those paintings, attracted peers – and a streak of invitations to visit artists in their studios.\r\n \r\n\r\nClose Quarters marks Brennan Hinton’s debut curatorial effort and continues his interest in observation and kinship. 1969 will publish a catalog featuring exhibition artwork images, an essay about studio practices and Brennan Hinton’s 30-day diary recording his personal thoughts and revealing the intense, intimate and ongoing relationships among a select group of contemporary visual artists.\r\n\r\nParticipating Artists:\r\n\r\nCoady Brown\r\n\r\nKeiran Brennan Hinton\r\n\r\nSarah Esme Harrison\r\n\r\nSarah Faux\r\n\r\nAlex Jackson\r\n\r\nCindy Ji Hye Kim\r\n\r\nDoron Langberg\r\n\r\nDani Levine"

          "Jack Hanley Gallery presents the first solo exhibition with Berlin based artist Isabelle Fein who works in various media blurring the lines between painting and drawing. The exhibition features new figurative works on board, canvas and paper as well as painted ceramic plates and sculptures. \r\n \r\nIsabelle Fein’s paintings depict simple observations of the artist’s everyday life and surroundings: a bird sitting on a wire, a snail crossing the sidewalk, a woman holding on to an umbrella in the rain or a stranger reading the newspaper on the tram. Transferred into dream-like settings, Fein creates sceneries of landscapes, people, animals, plants and objects in which inner and outer life coexist. Through her curiosity and awareness for details and situations, Fein pays equal attention to each object and figure. Her non-traditional compositions reject any hierarchical order or chronology and inhere a sense of ease and freedom. \r\n \r\nThis freedom is also visible in her use of materials and technique. Whether painterly brushstrokes of oil on board, fine contoured lines on ceramic plates or soft layers of india ink on canvas, what unifies Fein’s visual vocabulary is the joy to experiment. This playful latitude is paired with a tranquility and meditativeness found in her figure’s characters. Often presented isolated from each other, abstracted and lost in thought, they exist in their own time and space. \r\n \r\nIn small scale ceramic sculptures these characters seem to have escaped the borders of the two-dimensional and expand Fein’s arcane realities.   \r\n \r\nIsabelle Fein (born 1973 in Wiesbaden, Germany) lives and works in Berlin. She studied film and drawing at the Hochschule für Gestaltung in Offenbach, Germany and the Städelschule Frankfurt am Main. Recent solo exhibitions include Galerie Parisa Kind, Frankfurt and Fort Gansevoort Gallery, New York. The artist also participated in exhibitions at Center Berlin, Acud Project Space and Halle für Kunst Lüneburg, DE.  "

Condo arose from a reevaluation of existing exhibition models, a desire to pool resources and act communally, and the need to activate the gallery space in a different manner.

          "Project Native Informant presents historical works of Harumi Yamaguchi for CONDO NY. A leading name in the world of Japanese advertising, she pioneered the highly dramatic but elusively flat airbrush aesthetic closely associated with commercial illustration. Yamaguchi’s practice places her in the vanguard of new painterly practices and as a celebrated documenter of an emerging feminist aesthetic from the 1970s onwards.\r\n\r\nBorn in Matsue in the Shimane prefecture, Yamaguchi graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts in oil painting. She began her career as a freelance illustrator, spearheading the advertising for the renowned retail establishment PARCO. From its outset, PARCO was established to combine a commercial retail establishment with a cultural facility, combining platforms such as museum, theater, and publishing in addition to retail. Yamaguchi’s role as engineer of the project’s mise-en-scène places her in the center of art and design in Japan.\r\n\r\nAs one of the original gyaru—commonly known also as “Shibuya Girls” rising from out ūman ribu or the feminist movements of the 1970s and generally applied to professionally-empowered but trend-conscious young women—Yamaguchi’s position at PARCO gave her license to portray an emerging cosmopolitan woman, liberated from the vestiges of traditional femininity and empowered through consumerism to define her own individuality. “Harumi’s gals” are often active and in motion—be it throwing a ball or swimming in a crystal blue pool—and returning the gaze of the viewer. As Chizuko Ueno noted in her essay published in connection to “Women of the 70s PARCO Poster Exhibition 1969-1986” exhibition that took place at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in 2001, “while appearing to adhere to the scenario of male-tailored eroticism, Yamaguchi deconstructs male desire through her exaggerative depictions. As a consequence, the female body is idealized to a realm unreachable by male hands”.\r\n\r\nYamaguchi is in the collection of: CCGA Graphic Art Center, Fukushima Kawasaki City Museum, Kanagawa, Japan Museum of Modern Art, New York Walker Art Center, Minneapolis\r\n"

          "Every emerging minority needs not only a record of its grievances but also an idealized image of its expectations. \r\nTom Bianchi has given us one version of gay happiness – an earthly paradise where handsome men love one another on white sands under an eternally cloudless sky. \r\nThese photographs are at once formal and intimate, for they bring both rigor and tenderness to glimpses of real people. – Edmund White\r\n\r\nTHROCKMORTON FINE ART presents an unusual show of Polaroid images as its summer presentation. FIRE ISLAND PINES: Polaroids 1975-1983, by the celebrated lawyer-turned-artist Tom Bianchi, contains dozens of exuberantly playful and homoerotic SX-70 Polaroid images taken between 1975 and 1983. Bianchi documented the gay community at play in one of the few places where they then could openly be gay men — Fire Island Pines. \r\n\r\nThe images in the exhibition are color, limited edition, enlarged prints of the Polaroids.  The photographs are whimsical and playful.  Yet they also harken to the long tradition in art of celebrating the male physique.\r\n\r\nThe Pines is a mile-long sliver of some 600 modest and grand houses on a 36-mile long barrier island 60 miles east of Manhattan along the Long Island coast. FIRE ISLAND PINES: Polaroids 1975-1983 is an homage to the free-spirited community that was Fire Island Pines in what is often called the “golden” age in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nThe Pines was a refuge for as many as 10,000 gay men each weekend who pulled their little red wagons from the harbor to their homes and reveled at afternoon “Tea Dances” and legendary bacchanals.  For many it was their first chance to openly walk hand to hand on the beach with a romantic partner.\r\n\r\nKraige Block, Executive Director and Director of Photography at Throckmorton Fine Art says, “It is nearly impossible for younger generations to understand today just how circumspect gay men had to be back in those days.  There were laws against homosexual activity and men risked their reputations, livelihoods, and very lives if discovered.  In the cities, police decoys trolled for arrests, and blackmail threats caused many men to bottle up their desires for emotional and physical intimacy.”\r\n\r\nSpencer Throckmorton adds “We are fortunate that Tom Bianchi earned the trust of enough gay men to allow him to record their lives in the rare place where they could feel safe and accepted. Many were wary of having their pictures taken. But by sharing the Polaroids with them, the men he shot could see that Bianchi was celebrating them.”\r\n\r\nIt has taken over thirty years for us to see his book of Polaroids in print. Publishers long found the book “too queer” to be commercial: “the public” did not want to see homosexuals.  Despite impressive endorsements from those in the art world, including Sam Wagstaff, Duane Michals and Andy Warhol, Bianchi put the book on hold as the AIDS pandemic devastated the gay community. The box he used to store the images became a mausoleum.\r\n\r\nYet Bianchi still views those years, 1975-1983, as “magical.”\r\n“The blazing sun, the naked bodies in the surf, and the dance music attracted a mix of world class celebrities, models, designers, artists – the best and the brightest.”  They gave Bianchi his creative voice.  “In the Pines, my dreams of being an out gay man and artist became possible.”\r\nFortunately, Bianchi’s weekend artwork came to the attention of Betty Parsons and Carol Dreyfuss who gave him his first one-man show of paintings in 1980.  Betty Parsons is the legendary dealer who introduced abstract modern art through masters such as Jackson Pollack, Mark Rothko, Clifford Still, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg.  That show gave Bianchi the courage to discard his law degree and become a full-time artist.\r\nWhen his lover died of AIDS in 1988, Bianchi turned his focus to photography, employing the camera to heal psychic, sexual and social shame. He has exhibited at galleries and museums in the United States and beyond. His works are held in many private and public collections. Bianchi has produced twenty-one books exploring sexual identity.\r\n\r\nThe moving memoir Bianchi wrote for FIRE ISLAND PINES: POLAROIDS 1975-1983, together with the photographs, recorded the birth and development of a new culture at a critical time in America’s political and aesthetic life.  Much of the good we see accomplished today for gay civil liberties and queer consciousness began on the beach at Fire Island. Bianchi was there, ensuring that the beauty of the moment would live on."

          "Luhring Augustine presents MEDIAWAKE, an exhibition of works by German artist Ferdinand KRIWET.\r\n \r\nAt its core, KRIWET’s work embraces principles of Concrete Poetry, in which visual strategies such as typographical composition and repetition of text are employed to create meaning in a poem. Expanding on these concepts he took a uniquely political and avant-garde approach to art making. Though not formally trained as a writer or artist, he infused his work with a varied body of influences, such as Constructivism, Beat Poetry, Pop Art, as well as the writings of Walter Benjamin. KRIWET was far ahead of his time in many respects, particularly in his appropriation of mass media to analyze the languages and cultural influences of television, advertising, and commercial photography.\r\n \r\nKRIWET regarded his film works as autonomously moving poems which he called Texte-Filme. These sound and picture collages are characterized by dynamic fast cuts and an affinity for optical patterns and graphic surfaces. In 1969, KRIWET traveled to New York with the intention of collating the media broadcasts and printed matter reporting on the Apollo 11 launch. Renting a room at the Chelsea Hotel, he set up numerous television sets and filmed them with a 16mm camera; he also collected sound bites from radio broadcasts, recording the event from take-off to landing. Using the cut-up method, he assembled these articles of mass media into audio, book, and film works. The resulting film, Apollovision was shown nationwide on German television later that year. \r\n \r\nBroadcast media played a critical and powerful role in American politics, as demonstrated by the televised debates between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon which were pivotal in determining the election’s outcome. The film Campaign (1972-73) examines the media’s reaction to the presidential race between George McGovern and Richard Nixon, looking not just at the events themselves, but rather the way in which they were reported. KRIWET’s work brilliantly records the visual strength of images and graphics, recognizing the emergence of the ‘sound bite’ and ‘talking head’ phenomena.  \r\n \r\nThe discourse of public address is a theme KRIWET continuously explored. His Text Signs (1968) made from stamped aluminum are formatted with the character of commercial signage, the text, arranged in the round, asserts idea that the phrase has no beginning or end. Pieces such as Text Dia (1970), also a composition of text in concentric circles, are printed on clear PVC. Suspended in space, the works juxtapose words visually within their environment. \r\n \r\nKRIWET was born in Düsseldorf in 1942. Since publishing his first book at the age of 19 he has produced a body of work across a wide range of media including books, paintings collages, performance, installation, audio works for radio broadcast, films, and sculptural reliefs. Further to his art projects he has created information delivery systems for municipal and commercial buildings. Recent exhibitions of the artist’s work include solo shows at Cherry and Martin, Los Angeles, CA (2015); Fri Art Kunsthalle Fribourg, Switzerland (2013); KRIWET: Yester ’n’ Today, Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Germany (2011); Galerie im Taxispalais, Innsbruck, Austria (2011); The Modern Institute, Glasgow (2008); and BQ, Berlin (2013 and 2010)."

          "As a part of CONDO Complex New York, a gallery swap between New York galleries and national and international partners, Metro Pictures hosts Leo Xu’s two-part exhibition A New Ballardian Vision. The show brings together a selection of works that reflect recent social, technological and environmental developments through the lens of author J.G. Ballard’s (1930–2009) writings. Xu conceived the exhibition as two distinct chapters; the first features Metro Pictures artists Nina Beier, Camille Henrot, Martin Kippenberger, Oliver Laric, Robert Longo, Trevor Paglen, Jim Shaw and Cindy Sherman. The second chapter focuses on a younger generation of Chinese artists represented by Leo Xu Projects, including aaajiao, Chen Wei, Cheng Ran, Cui Jie, Li Qing, Liu Shiyuan and Pixy Liao.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter One, a recent untitled painting by Jim Shaw references imagery from H.G. Wells’s dystopian science fiction classic War of the Worlds. The painting features a figure based on Gilded Age industrialist William Henry Vanderbilt, depicted as a bloated gas bag scouring an ominous post-industrial cityscape with vacuum tentacles sucking up denizens in his path. Alongside Shaw’s work is a selection of photographs from Cindy Sherman’s Disasters series, which was first shown at Metro Pictures in 1987. The often grotesque tableaux are suggestive of macabre narratives and taboo psychosexual fantasies. Dark psychological currents are also evident in the works of Trevor Paglen, which directly address the omnipresence of the US surveillance state using the tropes of traditional landscape photography and painting.\r\n \r\nChapter Two includes works from seven Chinese artists represented by Leo Xu Projects. Both Chen Wei’s cinematically-staged photographs and Cui Jie’s multi-layered paintings reimagine China’s already strange urban landscapes after reform and opening-up. Li Qing paints post-apocalyptic scenes inspired by Hollywood films on windows made during Shanghai’s colonial period. Liu Shiyuan’s photo-collages and fictional diary tell the story of an anonymous female artist’s trek around the world and her subsequent encounters with political turmoil and war. aaajiao’s video installation draws on society’s obsession with social media and the culture of constant approval, conditions anticipated in Ballard’s writing.\r\n\r\nLeo Xu is a Shanghai-based curator, writer and gallerist.\r\n\r\nEnglish novelist J.G. Ballard (1930–2009) was born and raised in the Shanghai International Settlement and was later imprisoned in an internment camp for European and American residents during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai during World War II. These experiences influenced the various dystopian themes found in his works."

In 2016 Vanessa Carlos founded Condo London as a way to offer international galleries a site for creative collaboration and exchange. \r\n \r\nNew York galleries will host a visiting gallery (or galleries) by either co-curating an exhibition together or dividing the host gallery into different exhibition spaces.  Condo arose from a reevaluation of existing exhibition models, a desire to pool resources and act communally, and the need to activate the gallery space in a different manner.  Through this partnership, Condo offers a more generous and encouraging environment for the global presentation of experimental exhibitions.\r\n "

          "Derek Eller Gallery presents an exhibition of work by Cynthia Daignault, Dan Fischer and Ellen Lesperance. The artists in this exhibition have catalogued creative labor by gathering images and have built non-didactic indexes of those actions. Textiles, art historic documentation, and ephemera from the artist’s studio practice have been collected, organized and re-imagined.\r\n \r\nIn Cynthia Daignault’s Reading Room 1 and Reading Room 2, a series of canvases are arranged face up within vitrines, alluding to a museum display of artifacts. The canvases are gestural reproductions at times rendered illegible by their painterly touch. These displays contain far-flung sources ranging from album and book covers to post-it notes. Collectively they catalogue the fleeting objects that inhabit her studio, items that indirectly guide and inspire her practice, effectively constructing an aesthetic bibliography to accompany her practice as a whole.\r\n \r\nDan Fischer’s meticulous drawings pay homage to deeply influential artists and artworks. An exercise in devotional realism, Fischer gathers photocopies from books and journals which he re-creates in graphite with an uncanny mechanical accuracy. Fischer employs a grid to transcribe these images while simultaneously drawing attention to their rendering. Images presented range from esoteric (a caricature of John Cage by Philip Guston) to iconic (photographic documentation of Yves Klein’s Anthropométries performances) yet each is treated with the same unwavering precision, allowing Fischer to unpack the largess of this history by losing himself in the minutia of the details.\r\n \r\nGouache and graphite paintings on paper by Ellen Lesperance are inspired by hand-knit clothing worn by women involved in protests and acts of civil disobedience. Several paintings stem from her work archiving such garments worn by members of the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp in Berkshire, England. Through collective actions, this group utilized aesthetics of domesticity to protest nuclear armament and the housing of nuclear weapons in southern England. The patterns from their knitted garments serve as a foundation for building layered abstractions in Lesperence’s paintings while allowing her to actively and personally engage with this political history and these creative acts.\r\n \r\nCynthia Daignault lives and works in Baltimore, MD, and New York, NY. Solo exhibitions include Capital Gallery, San Francisco, CA;  The FLAG Art Foundation, New York, NY; Stems Gallery, Brussels, Belgium; Lisa Cooley Gallery, New York, NY; Rowhouse Project,Baltimore, MD; among others. Her paintings have been featured in museum exhibitions, including at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver; the Fort Worth Modern; the Brooklyn Museum. In 2017, Daignault will be exhibiting at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY; MASS MOCA, North Adams, MA; and the Herron Museum of Art, Indianapolis, IN.\r\n \r\nDan Fischer lives and works in Las Vegas, NV. He has mounted solo exhibitions at Derek Eller Gallery, New York, NY; Alison Jacques Gallery, London, UK; and ACME., Los Angeles, CA. His work has been included in museum exhibitions at the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, Germany among others. His drawings are included in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Tate, London; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; High Museum of Art, Atlanta; and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\r\n \r\nEllen Lesperance lives and works in Portland, Oregon. Her work has been exhibited recently at the Drawing Center, New York, NY; Seattle Art Museum, WA; Ashland Art Museum, OR; Portland Institute of Contemporary Art, OR; the Dahl Arts Center, Rapid City, SD; Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, Winston Salem, NC; Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, AZ; and the Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery, Haverford, PA. Her work is included in the collections of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, the Brooklyn Museum, New York; the Museum of Art and Design, New York; the Portland Art Museum, OR; Schneider Museum of Art, Ashland, OR; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA; and the Kadist Art Foundation, San Francisco, CA. The artist has received grants and awards from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Art Matters, Pollock Krasner Foundation and the Ford Family Foundation.\r\n "

          "Aicon Gallery presents Cuckoonebulopolis: (Flora and) Fauna, the first major New York solo exhibition by Baroda-based artist Surendran Nair. The exhibition is a collection of paintings and drawings inspired by The Birds, a play by the Greek playwright Aristophanes. In the play, a man convinces birds to establish their new city in the clouds, later named Cloud Cuckoo Land, which translates to Cuckoonebulopis. At the heart of Nair’s work is the notion of this nebulous utopia - he reflects on the strange, ironic, and sometimes improbable possibilities that humans dream of when designing a utopia.\r\n\r\nThe cycle of works, Cuckoonebulopolis, has grown immensely since early 2000, when Nair first took on the project. He draws and paints his imagined actors from The Birds, dressed in elaborate costumes and masks, taking on the identity of various birds (flamingos, owls, sparrows and pelicans, to name a few). His loose, long, and whimsical titles hint at his initially lighthearted and humorous approach; however, as he realized the nuances between the “cuckoo” birds and their utopia, Nair clarified their relationship to the clouds with his unique iconography, drawing from traditional performing arts, history and mythology, and the real and imaginary.\r\n\r\nThe works, however, are not in any way meant as arguments against or in favor of any particular manifestation of utopian desires. Nair’s interest in utopia stops at the very basic threshold, where and when it makes one compelled to imagine something other than what is already in existence. It is not the proposal for an alternative future that interests him, but the critical engagement with the present. This idea is then employed as a backdrop, a theatrical device, to sharpen the contours of Nair’s images whilst they are at play, to accentuate the tenor of whatever they may address.\r\n\r\nAs Mumbai-based poet, critic and curator Ranjit Hoskote has stated:\r\n\r\n“Nair regards painting as no less interactive a medium than the installation or the digital interface: a coded yet inviting communication around which artist and viewer choreograph a productive dialogue. The act of painting is, for Nair, an offering of metaphors to his viewers: metaphors from which they can gauge the curve of the artist’s imagination while also staging their own imaginative departures. Accordingly, the emphasis shifts between the artistic imagination and the viewerly one, from one painting to another. The artist indicates that some of his works are programmed in a relatively open-ended fashion; they function as scripts, around which viewers can improvise their own performances: some of Nair’s paintings dedicated to the figure of the actor, such as I Beg Your Pardon: The Scorpion Act II - an actor meditating on a character of an imaginary play (Cuckoonebulopolis, 2002), function in this manner.”\r\n\r\nSurendran Nair studied Painting at the College of Fine Arts in Kerala and completed a post diploma in Printmaking at the University of Baroda in India. He has had several solo shows of his work apart from participating in prominent group exhibitions. Recent solo exhibitions include Spatial Arrangements of Colors, Lines, Forms and Desires, Sakshi Gallery, Mumbai, India (2015), Surendran Nair: Drawings, Print and Watercolours (1970s-1990s), Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA), New Delhi, India (2015), Neti Neti, Frey Norris Gallery, San Francisco, CA, U.S. (2010), and The Bad Behaviour of Singularities, presented by Sakshi Gallery, Mumbai at Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, India (2006). Prominent group exhibitions include Whorled Explorations curated by Jitish Kallat, Kochi-Muziris Biennale, Kochi, India (2015), Looking Glass: The Existence of Difference, Twenty Indian Contemporary Artists presented by Religare Arts Initiative, New Delhi in collaboration with American Centre; British Council; Goethe-Institut/ Max Mueller Bhavan, New Delhi, India (2010), Anxious, Galerie Mirchandani + Steinruecke, Mumbai, India (2008), Horn Please: Narratives in Indian Contemporary Art, Kunnst Museum, Bern, Switzerland, Edge of Desire: Recent Art In India, Asia Society Museum, New York (2005), Capital and Karma - Recent Positions in Indian Art, Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, Austria (2002), and The 1st Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Japan (1999)."

          "Carter Burden Gallery presents three new exhibitions: Summer in the City in the East Gallery featuring 14 gallery artists; East Harlem Diptychs in the West Gallery featuring Ellen Wallenstein; and On the Wall featuring Barbara Lubliner.  \r\n\r\nSummer in the City, a title inspired by the 1966 song by The Lovin’ Spoonful, celebrates the early days of summer by presenting the recent works of 14 gallery artists. Summer in the City features an eclectic range of mediums by Olivia Beens, Myrna Burks, Karin Bruckner, Elisabeth Jacobsen, Robert Ludwig, Carol Massa, Margo Mead, Kate Misset, Rod Recor, Nieves Saah, Vera Sapozhnikova, Sheila Schwid, Angela Valeria, and Jerry Vezzuso.\r\n \r\nIn On the Wall, Barbara Lubliner presents an installation entitled Upcycled Tubes: Assert, Defend, Surrender &amp; Youngsters in her first solo show at Carter Burden Gallery. For this installation Lubliner utilizes discarded cardboard tubes to elicit body language and the pared down form of individuals. The artist states “by re-purposing trash into playful art, I shift the focus from environmental blight to creative production.” Each figure is in an expressive posture and relates to the attitude and feelings that embody each of us. \r\n\r\nIn East Harlem Diptychs, Ellen Wallenstein presents photographs that illustrate the vibrancy of one of Manhattan’s transitioning neighborhoods. The artist describes East Harlem as “one of the last neighborhoods to be gentrified” in New York City and the images show her interest in the multi-cultural signs and symbols that represent the populace there. As a teacher and book artist, Wallenstein is interested in the sequencing of photographs and how their positions relative to one another can influence what is being conveyed. “I photograph as pleasure, as practice, as meditation and as homage; for my sanity and my delight; because I must, because I have to; to teach from, to learn from, to look at, to remember.”"

          "Bortolami presents concrete realities, a two-person exhibition by Tom Burr and Andrea Zittel. Since the 1990s, Burr and Zittel have trained their attention on the built environment, addressing questions of site-specificity, subjectivity, and the body. This exhibition focuses on their ongoing projects in sites outside of art world centers, which find the artists developing distinct, but congruent methods of tackling their overlapping spatial concerns.\r\n \r\nAndrea Zittel founded A-Z West in the California High Desert near Joshua Tree National Park in 2000 as a “life project” in which all aspects of day-to-day living become the site of investigation into human nature and the social construction of need. Included in the exhibition are Tellus Interdum and Single Strand Forward Motion (both 2011), which make visible the patterns of everyday routines. For Tellus Interdum, Zittel replaces the articles in an issue of her local Yucca Valley newspaper with lorem ipsum placeholder text and applies the sheets to gallery walls in a loose grid formation. The work highlights the newspaper’s capacity to compartmentalize and routinize its ever-changing daily content. Single Strand Forward Motion extends this rumination on the ontological frameworks we inhabit. Each of Zittel’s Single Strand works is created according to a “rule-set” that then determines its defining pattern. The shapes of the works are never the same, but the rule-sets always result in visually identifiable geometries. More recent works in the exhibition include Parallel Planar Panels and Hard Carpets (both 2014) from an ongoing series that explores the subtle contextual shifts that establish a planar object’s identity and function. Put simply, panels on the floor become rugs or carpets while panels on the wall become fine art and thereby objects to be viewed, but not necessarily handled or used.\r\n \r\nTom Burr has produced six new bulletin board works related to his current Artist/City project, BODY / BUILDING, at the Marcel Breuer-designed office building in New Haven, Connecticut that was previously occupied by the Armstrong Rubber Company and the Pirelli Tire Company, and is now owned by IKEA. Burr, who was born in New Haven, weaves together images of cultural figures that have shaped the city’s past, including Jean Genet, Anni Albers, J. Edgar Hoover, and Jim Morrison. Pinned on wood boards with thumbtacks, the images form an oblique social network that merges with Burr’s own personal history. While often semi-autobiographical in nature, the new bulletin board works specifically address the confluence of urban development, modernism, and radical utopian political programs in New Haven during the 1960s and 70s, reflecting on the movements through the prism of their protagonists and the aspirations they have come to represent. Using an approach that balances formalism with intuition, Burr’s emotive grids provoke a contextual reading of history that brings to light overlooked associations.\r\n \r\nAndrea Zittel (b. 1965 in Escondido, CA) lives and works in Joshua Tree, CA. Selected solo exhibitions include Andrea Zittel, Regen Projects, Los Angeles, 2017; On the Grid: a look at settlement patterns in the high desert, Palm Springs Art Museum, Palm Springs, 2017; Andrea Zittel, Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York, 2016; Parallel Planar Panels, Sprüth Magers, Berlin, 2015; Andrea Zittel: The Flat Field Works, Middelheim Museum, Antwerp, 2015. Selected group exhibitions include Atlas I, Fondazione Prada, Milan, 2017; L’Esprit du Bauhaus, Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, 2016; Human Interest: Portraits from the Whitney’s Collection, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 2016; Future Present, Schaulager, Müchenstein, 2015 and NYC 1993, New Museum, New York, 2013.\r\n \r\nTom Burr (b. 1963 in New Haven, CT) lives and works in New York. Selected solo exhibitions include Tom Burr/New Haven: Pre-Existing Conditions, Marcel Breuer Armstrong Rubber Building, New Haven, 2017; Surplus of Myself, Westfälischer Kunstverein, Münster, 2017; Circa, Bortolami, New York, 2015; Addict – Love, Sculpture Center, New York, 2008; Gone, Gone, American Fine Arts, New York, 2003; Deep Purple, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 2002. Selected group exhibitions include Skulptur Projekte 2017, Münster, 2017; Question the Wall Itself, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 201; Béton, Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, 2016 and Take It or Leave It: Institution, Image, Ideology, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, 2014."

          "Rachel Uffner Gallery presents a three-person show with work by Maria Berrio, Derek Fordjour, and Ebony G. Patterson. Each artist brings a unique global perspective to their art making, which questions notions of individual and collective collective identities that lie beneath seductive surfaces.\r\n \r\nWomen are central to Maria Berrio’s magical-realist dreamscapes. Born in Bogotá, Colombia, Berrio spent her childhood on her family’s mountainside farm, then moved to New York at the age of eighteen. The South American folklore and mythology integral to her formative years, along with lingering memories of an intense connection to nature, inform her large, meticulous mixed-media canvases. Berrio’s goddesses of the natural world, each carefully crafted with multitudinous, lush layers of Japanese rice paper, appear to determine their own surreal surroundings. To Berrio, this alliance with nature symbolizes a potential that is frequently untapped in the modern world; her subject’s powerful womanhood, allied with the creatures of the earth, is a strength that must not be forgotten.\r\n \r\nThe representational, multi-media sculptures and works on paper of Derek Fordjour, born in Memphis, Tennessee to parents of Ghanaian heritage, explore the human experience of fragility, and how we express agency over societal demands of strength. Using athletes as subjects for these conversations about the vulnerability of those deemed heroic, Fordjour creates sculptural totem poles of terra cotta and coal men wearing antiquated sports gear, which, in their seemingly inherent structural instability, speak to the tenuous nature of power. It feels as if these stacked sculptures could topple with the slightest touch. Both in space and on paper, Fordjour’s portraits are reduced simply to race, gender, and uniform, stripping his subjects of individuality, and creating identity through numbers and teams, while simultaneously implicating the viewer in the profiling process.\r\n\r\nJamaica-born Ebony G. Patterson challenges who holds the power to determine and frame a life as “of value.” In her when they grow up series, Patterson creates collage and installation-based portraits of children in adolescence, which function both as memorial to the deceased and shrine to martyred saints. Appalled by the way in which child victims of color are treated with a lack of empathy, dismissed, and even implicated by society and the media as the cause of their own deaths, Patterson reclaims the humanity of her subjects while reminding the viewer of their innocence. Surrounding her portraits with purposefully overemphasized tokens of childhood, Patterson examines the tenuous relationship between race and age when converged with public perceptions of innocence and guilt, or blame. Using post-production to enhance their rosy glows, Patterson recasts her subjects as cherubs, who through their glitter remain precious as gold.\r\n"

          "Featuring:\r\n\r\nAngelica Bergamini\r\nCharlie Jo Crowell\r\nKatie DeGroot\r\nEileen Ferara\r\nTessa Grundon\r\nJennifer Harris\r\n\r\n\r\nNoelle King\r\nAya Ogasawara\r\nKay Reese\r\nAdie Russell\r\nRon Saunders \r\nMJ Tyson\r\n\r\nString Theories is a group exhibition, curated from the gallery submissions at Field Projects in Chelsea, NYC. This exhibition examines the vibrational strings that connect humanness, cultural identities, relationships with nature, industrialization, and the subconscious. Examining connections through diverse media, String Theories include alternative photography techniques, painting, mixed media, printmaking, sculpture and video.\r\n\r\nRon Saunders, from San Francisco, uses sepia toned silver print photograms to combine fragmented human portraits and nature. The sepia tones use the silhouettes of trees within the head, or the shadows of feet on veiny leaves. The reflected fragmented self and the spirit of nature are combined with reference to history, race and gender. Earth tones, sacred geometry and silhouettes are also evident in the series. San Fransisco based artist Jennifer Harris creates geometric webs in her piece Cultivate, reflecting on human perspectives or lost perspectives and lack of communication. Kay Reese examines identity and relationships within cross cultural heritage in her figurative found object sculpture Conditioned. The piece sits low to the ground with a mirrored base with asks the viewer to relate their own perceptions of self. Her work responds to society’s institutionalized class, gender, political, social and racial power systems.\r\n\r\nNew York based Noelle King presents a discussion of our human connection with nature and the spirit of mother with Moss Phone. The classic black rotary phone has ancient species of moss growing in place of a rotary. The piece questions how we call in our past relationships with nature within our contemporary society. Katie DeGroot, living in upstate NY, personifies trees in her paintings and honors their unique abilities to adapt and survive. Sometimes they are adorned like showgirls putting on the most fantastic costumes adorned in moss, mushroom or vines. The relationship between humans and the personification of trees is ancient, but here it has a modern take with saturated color schemes.\r\n\r\nNew York based Tessa Grundon is moved by topography, history of a place, ever-changing environments, and the relationship between land and people. Her work is created from local maps, beeswax from nearby hives, pigments drawn from the mud, various colored earths, vegetation, rust and charcoal. The delicate abstractions are markers of place, time, and experience. Estuaries and local waterways inspire the installation created by printmaker Eileen Ferera. She focuses on the plant Trapa Natans, an invasive species of water plant introduced in the US in the 1870’s.\r\n\r\nCharlie Jo Crowell’s instillation, Room With a View, expresses the yearning for natural elements within our modern industrial surroundings. He investigates the tension between being and non-being within public and private emotional ecosystems. Within our humanness there is a craving for nature and connection but the blocked view seems like a memory in time, or a fleeting connectivity. The small paintings of New York based, Aya Ogasawara resembles allegories of the subconscious, beauty, and womanhood. These small canvases include The Engagement, an extended hand with a ladybug replacing a diamond, and Her Silence, an open mouth with cobwebs surrounded by foliage.\r\n\r\nAdie Russell, residing in Kingston NY, works with great visions of landscape, particularly a great mountain that is blocked by bright colorful geometric rectangles. The contemporary industrial shapes overlay the view of the divine nature just beyond. She states” I think part of the appeal of nature, our construction of nature, is the obliteration of self. We long to hold within our limited vision a souvenir of an oblivious world.” MJ Tyson forms rectangular shapes resembling industrial totems made of discarded or lost personal memorabilia. The past crushed columns are remnant of an industrial structure, but they are created considering the cycles of creation and destruction and the forgotten materials from generations past. Angelica Bergamini, residing in Brooklyn, reflects on the human relationship with the subconscious in her video piece Untitled (Know Thyself Series). She seeks to find a balance between the inner and outer world in relation to our ephemeral presence on this planet. With poetically blinking eyes, it reflects our own thoughts. It vibrates with the greater cosmos around us.\r\n\r\nString Theories, the exhibition, invites the viewer to connect with self, nature, and the industrialized city that surrounds us. We are all a part of the larger vibrations interacting with each other and propagating through space."

          "Curated by Ashton Cooper\r\n\r\nIn the January 1971 issue of ARTnews, the magazine asked Elaine de Kooning and seven other artists to respond to an article they were publishing in the same issue: Linda Nochlin’s now-iconic essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” Right away, de Kooning took issue with the term “women artists,” using an anecdote to explain. \r\n\r\n“I was talking to Joan Mitchell at a party about 10 years ago when a man came up to us and said, ‘What do you women artists think…’ Joan grabbed my arm and said, ‘Elaine, let’s get the hell out of here.’”[1]\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of Joan and Elaine’s party exit, this show brings together artists working across disparate contexts and mediums whose practices take complicated and resistant positions on identity.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition begins with Mitchell and de Kooning and traces an attitude of refusal through successive generations of artists with kindred aesthetic gestures and interests. All of the artists in the show employ certain modernist strategies, but for their own means and with their own agendas. In disallowing materials, colors, and strokes from being pinned down, the work manifests a politicized expressionism.\r\n\r\nAcross the five generations of artists represented here, one can chart when and why certain labels (abstraction, expressionism, portraiture; gender, race, sexuality; drip, stain, pour) have historically been embraced or rejected. More importantly, however, the work exemplifies that sorting through all of the categories one might use to circumscribe a work of art is a messy and mercurial business. Each of the works on view remain ambivalent, even prickly, as they make and unmake the capacious boundaries of modernism. \r\n\r\nBeyond gendered constraints, Joan Mitchell (1925-1992) was also skeptical of tethering abstraction. “Abstract is not a style … it’s an ambivalence of forms and space,” she said in a 1986 interview.[2] Elaine de Kooning (1918-1989) and Grace Hartigan (1922-2008) too challenged the bounds of AbEx. Not only did both paint figuratively, but they rubbed shoulders with the queer subculture of the New York School.  Elaine de Kooning’s portrait captures poet, dance critic, and friend Edwin Denby who penned several poems about his nighttime walks with the de Koonings. [3] Grace Hartigan, as part of the second generation of the AbEx, was a close friend of poet and MoMA curator Frank O’Hara who dedicated his famous “In Memory of My Feelings” to her. [4]\r\n\r\nA decade later, second-wave feminists embraced the moniker “woman artist” as a category of empowerment. Rosemary Mayer (1943-2014) was a founder of A.I.R. Gallery and worked in the consciously feminist medium of fabric when many artists were reclaiming craft and women’s work. Yet, her interest in fabric was also born from a fascination with Italian Mannerism, specifically the work of Florentine painter Pontormo, whose diary she translated into English for the first time. [5] Joan Snyder (b.1940), who was painting at a time when the medium was spurned by her feminist contemporaries, linked abstraction to queer desire as evidenced in “Dear Irene.” “The strokes in my paintings speak of my life and experiences,” she wrote in 1972. [6] At the same time, Black artists were dealing with similar criticism from their peers about the political efficacy of abstract art. In a 1985 interview, Al Loving (1935-2005) explained the decision to move on from his early hard-edged abstraction: “The whole period of doing this geometric art conflicted with civil rights. There was no way to work that out so the pictures kept moving at their own rate.” [7]\r\n\r\nThe next generation of artists began their careers at the outset of postmodernism. For queer artists working at this time, identity was bound up with refusal (Lee Edelman has written that “the efficacy of queerness lies in its very willingness to embrace this refusal of the social and political order”). [8] Ralph Lemon (b.1952), widely known as a choreographer and dancer, has an extensive art practice, much of which is drawings. Here he depicts Miles Davis in his boxing attire.  Speaking of his multi-disciplinary practice, Lemon has recently said that he “refuse[s] the way the work gets coded” and that he “has taken on an identity politic of being culturally dysfunctional.” [9] Working primarily in crochet and fiber art, Sheila Pepe (b.1959) utilizes the materials of second-wave artists at the same time that she nods to modernist formal concerns in her impermanent installations. Pepe terms her work “hot mess formalism,” advancing a critique of canonicity and high/low binaries. \r\n\r\nComing of age in the 90s, Deborah Anzinger (b.1978) and Molly Zuckerman-Hartung (b.1975) address third-wave and postcolonial concerns. Anzinger, who is based in Kingston, Jamaica, uses abstraction to consider the site of her home country and the trope of woman-as-landscape in a Caribbean context. She posits slipperiness as a tool for survival in a postcolonial setting and, in the space of her canvas, allows forms and colors to embody two things at once and contradictions to survive simultaneously. The element of the mirror is not just an addition to her palette, but is used as a means to implicate the viewer. Zuckerman-Hartung’s unstretched painting counts sewn t-shirts, coat liner, wool, canvas, and dropcloth as its supports. The artist deals in androgyny: She paints with bleach (“The mark of presence is also the mark of absence.”) and denies the abstraction/figuration opposition (“It is a figure/ground issue. In abstraction, the figure and ground begin to flip. That’s what’s potent about it, getting your head around that and getting to understand the power of negative space or negativity in general. These flips begin to make the world so much stranger.”). [10]\r\n\r\nA younger generation of artists are mixing and matching all that precedes them. Alex Bradley Cohen’s (b.1989) portraits find kinship with both de Kooning and Lemon. The body of his subject Tariq is made up of a spectrum of strokes. Moreover, in the same way that Elaine and Joan left the party together in solidarity, Cohen is imaging the artist community around him, his friends and family.  Sable Elyse Smith’s (b.1986) video, born out of a real-time collaboration with a Baghdad-based university student, showcases the failure of language. Smith manipulates video with a painterly quality — utilizing layering, collage, and opacity to refuse a conventional way of looking and understanding. The artist mines the gaps in language and images. Working in the tradition of making paintings on the ground, Vanessa Thill (b.1991) leaves her marks and flows to chance and chemical reaction. The piece on view is composed of coffee, fabric dye, metallic pigment, fake blood, epoxy resin, Elmer’s glue, and two dozen other ingredients found at the dollar store down the block from her studio. In a recent poem titled “Decade Doors,” Thill writes, “Dry tornado/all the ab-ex moves/Disappeared into the weather/dry it out/peel it up.”\r\n\r\n1 Elaine de Kooning and Rosalyn Drexler, “Dialogue,” ARTnews, January 1971.\r\n2 Yves Michaud, “Conversations with Joan Mitchell, January 12, 1986,” in Joan Mitchell: New Paintings (New York: Xavier Fourcade, 1986).\r\n3  Edwin Denby, “The Silence at Night,” in Dance Writings and Poetry (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1988).\r\n4  Frank O’Hara, “In Memory of My Feelings,” in In Memory of My Feelings (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1967). \r\n5  Rosemary Mayer, Pontormo’s Diary (New York: Out of London Press, 1982).\r\n6  Joan Snyder, artist’s statement 1972, in Joan Snyder, ed.

          "Bryce Wolkowitz Gallery presents Lots on View, an exhibition of new work by Ryan Brown. \r\n\r\nThe cycle of drawings in this exhibition contends that the meaning of a work of art is bound to the context by which it is presented. The implied neutrality of the gallery, its latent societal and economic functions are interrogated, exposed and absorbed into the drawings themselves. The form of pages from an enlarged art catalogue offer an analogy to support the overarching theme of hyper-reflection, where all points of reference loop, feedback and spiral inwards towards an indefinite center.\r\n\r\nImages of anonymous abstract paintings contribute to the loop by matter-of-factly describing themselves. The effect blurs the distinction between opposites: copy to original, source to residual, end to beginning. There’s a strong element of self-parody, satirizing the inscrutable figure of the artist. A meta-narrative builds up through the margins: notes become clues, captions become riddles and titles are an open act of deception. The subsequent equalization of the aesthetics of auction catalogues to the art they purport to describe, classify and sell, questions the purpose of meaning, the meaning of purpose and the very meaning of meaning in art.\r\n\r\nRyan Brown lives and works in New York and Lima, Peru. Recent solo exhibitions include Variations on a Theme, Max Estrella, Madrid; Stare at the Wall, OMR, Mexico City and To Hell With It All, Let’s Pray That It Lasts, Y Gallery, New York. His work is in the collection of CIFO Cisneros Fontanals Foundation, Miami; Fundacion JUMEX, Mexico City and the Zabludowicz Collection, London among others."

          "Gallery presents (home) a national juried group show framed around the word home in parentheses. As an all-encompassing idea that is charged with emotion, (home) may be just an overused advertising meme; (home) also serves as a political knot of identity, security or displacement. James Baldwin wrote “Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.” Distinguished artist Joan Bankemper is the juror for this midsummer show.\r\n \r\nArtists selected for the exhibition: Leah Appel, Michelle Auerbacher,  Ronald Butler, Cat Byrnes, Lloyd Campbell, Pauline Chernichaw, Jody Christian, Erin Codey, bdcousineau, Phil Desantis, Lawrence Dobens, Nancy Doniger, Mollie Douthit, Aaron Eidman, Scott Fisk, Amy Fox-Bisagni, Linda Gallop, Fukuko Harris, Diana Leidel, Loretta Lomanto, Min Lu, Kelly McCarthy, Robert Pennington, Corey Phillips-Fowler, Marvine Pierre, Dominic Quintana, James Rose, Tanya Sue Todd, Carole Turbin, Amy Weil, Mary Wright, Mary Younkin\r\n \r\nJuror Joan Bankemper has shown with Creative Time, Inc., NY; The New Museum, NY; Artpace, San Antonio, TX; The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, MA; and Wave Hill, Riverdale, NY. Bankemper received grants from The George Sugarman Foundation and the NEA. The McColl Center of Visual Arts awarded her the Gabi Award. Bankemper’s videos and videograms have been exhibited at Leo Castelli Gallery NY; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Detroit Institute of the Arts; The Padiglione d’Arte Contemporanea, Milan; Marianne Boesky Gallery, NY and the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, DC."

          "Keith de Lellis Gallery presents the work of Pictorialist photographer Doris Ulmann (American, 1882-1934) for its summer exhibition at 1045 Madison Avenue.\r\n \r\nA graduate of the Clarence White School of Photography and one of the earliest social documentary photographers, Ulmann began her career in New York, creating portraits of elite writers, artists, and intellectuals in her Park Avenue apartment. The artist captured both her humble and prominent subjects alike with great care and dignity. Ulmann sought out “A face that has the marks of having lived intensely, that expresses some phase of life, some dominant quality or intellectual power” in her portraiture (Bookman 72).\r\n \r\nHer inclination towards those who have “lived intensely” explains her dedication to documenting the people of rural Appalachia and the African American and Gullah communities of the Deep South, waning cultures of hardworking families bound by traditional values. The photographer approached folk artists, farmers, fishermen, and musicians to authentically capture their respective crafts. Although she was an upper-class New Yorker, she approached these humble communities with the respect and curiosity of an ethnographer.\r\n \r\nUlmann’s soft-focus platinum prints soothe the hardened features of her subjects, directing the viewer’s attention to their dignified and proud bearings. Her work blurs the lines between the documentarian and the fine art, combining her humanist background instilled by the Ethical Culture School with her Pictorialist training.\r\n \r\nThe soft natural light and rich shadows of Ulmann’s scenes maintain a focus on the figure. The subjects’ expressions are natural, pensive, and rarely is their gaze to the camera. They seem comfortable both in their environment and with the photographer.\r\n \r\n"

          "Limitlessness an exhibition by Jayanthi Moorthy, which features a selection of multimedia works created between 2015-2017. The exhibition is comprised by a site-specific video installation, a site-specific participatory installation, paintings, and archival pigment prints.\r\n \r\nLimitlessness aims to create an environment for self exploration. In this exhibition, Moorthy shares her own journey of introspection while looking at various limitations in her life. Understanding these limitations helped her think about the infinite, addressing it empowered her to pursue new passions and enduring it taught her to embrace reality. \r\n\r\nThe components of the exhibition attest aspects of this journey and invites the viewer to be a part of it. The artwork Fishing 1, highlights the fact that we can find infinite possibilities around us. The participatory installation What’s Your Worst Fear? generates a meditative space and asks the audience to identify, understand and reflect on the limits that fear enforces on them. In contrast Groovy Train, a video installation, shows how limits manifest in our daily lives.\r\n \r\nJayanthi Moorthy’s practice explores various aspects of personal and cultural identity, and their contemporary interpretations. She derives inspiration from ritual practices and philosophies from eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, which manifest in the themes that underlie her work, her choice of materials and method of drawing and painting. Ritual guides her practice of re-drawing and using repeated lines and/or texts in her drawings and paintings. Moorthy uses ephemeral materials such as rice flour, sand, and spices in her drawings and installations. The drawings are made on the floor; abstract and intuitive. Some of these drawings are photographed to make digital prints or are combined with digital projections in installations. In her paintings she squeezes blobs of acrylic paint on linen and canvas into repeated lines that acquire the tactile quality of thick woven threads. All these are complemented by community driven participatory installations that enable viewers to take part in a dialogue with the artist.\r\n \r\nMoorthy immigrated from India in 2004 and now lives and works in New York. Moorthy is predominantly a self-taught artist and has studied professional courses at The Arts Students League and MoMA. She is currently pursuing her Masters in Art Education and Community Practice at NYU. Moorthy’s solo exhibitions include, Brown University (RI), OED Gallery (India), DUMBO Arts Festival (New York); A.I.R. Gallery, (New York); Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art, (New York). She was recently awarded to participate in NYFA’s Immigrant Artist Program (New York) and won a Creative Engagement Grant from LMCC for her community project Art Fast. Apart from maintaining an active art practice, Moorthy works as an art educator at Abron Arts Center, NYC; is a freelance graphic designer; and an involved member of A.I.R. Gallery."

          "Anna Betbeze\r\nElaine Cameron-Weir\r\nLiz Craft\r\nCatharine Czudej\r\nDoreen Garner\r\nCy Gavin\r\nRochelle Goldberg\r\nWilliam Hawkins\r\nLena Henke\r\nJuliana Huxtable\r\nSam McKinniss\r\n\r\n“IF HISTORY WAS ROBBED, WE TAKE IT BACK BY PEELING AWAY AT LAYERS OF WIKIPEDIA DEBATES (SUBJECT LINE) RE:AUTHENTICITY.”\r\n— Juliana Huxtable, Mucus in my Pineal Gland\r\n\r\nIn 1894 in New York, an estimated 170,000 horses filled the streets as the city’s main source of transportation. 30 to 40 of these horses were said to collapse on the side of the road every day until their corpses were eventually hulled to Barren Island, a small island near the Rockaways in Brooklyn inhabited by Black, Irish, Italian and Polish communities. By the late 19th century, the island had become Manhattan’s landfill. So many horse corpses were brought to the island that a plant was built there to render horse bones into glue. In 1936, the communities of Barren Island were evicted, the landfill was capped, and six million cubic yards of sand were pumped from the bottom of Jamaica Bay to create the grounds for Floyd Bennett Field — New York City’s first municipal airport. In the 1950s, the east shore of the landfill cap burst, as if the dead horses of New York were returning, filling the air with the scent of their rotten corpses, fish, and trash. The area was later given the name Dead Horse Bay and while the name is entirely appropriate, it fails to remind us of the many communities of people who once lived on Barren Island. The displacement that took place in Dead Horse Bay is the subject of the work of Lena Henke and several such leaky histories serve as inspiration for this group exhibition. The artists included are each dedicated to an elastic processing of the world as a means of undoing mainstream historical narratives.\r\n\r\nHenke’s ceramics, four of which are on view here, deal with the urban expansion of the BQE. They are proposals for architecture devoted to those who were tragically displaced by the building of the highway. They resemble horse feet cum architecture and offer a distinctly anti-functional and highly hypothetical alternative to form-follows-function-modernism. Intentionally connecting the BQE to all urban developments designed by Robert Moses, Henke’s equestrian forms conflate the BQE with the Marine Highway Bridge built to create Floyd Bennett Field.\r\n\r\nCy Gavin’s paintings often focus on Bermuda’s landscapes and lesser known historical figures. The painting on view, titled Marsden Cemetery at Tucker’s Point, 2016 refers to Tucker’s Town, a 19th century settlement on Bermuda for emancipated slaves and their families. In the 1920s, it was seized through eminent domain and the community was supplanted with a tourist resort, with residents dispersed and shunted to tenements. While the characters and environments of Gavin’s paintings are, on the one hand, factually accurate to Bermuda’s untold past, there is a an elastic relationship to history, where the artist allows himself to create unrealistic dreamscapes of altered realities and, at times, characters that play between the symbolic and the specific. The figure in Marsden Cemetery at Tucker’s Point isn’t a specific person, but has a large disc-like head similar to the wooden fertility dolls of the West African Ashanti people known as akuaba. Gavin’s figure celebrates fertility while hovering over a grave in Tucker’s Point cemetery, showing a resilience of African traditions in the face of colonialism. \r\n\r\nLayers, 2016, by Doreen Garner, is constructed of cinder blocks, carpet padding, and fiberglass installation. These construction materials are covered with tinted silicone to mimic the texture of skin and all that bubbles underneath. Layers is based on the 1989 discovery of 10,000 human bones and skulls beneath the foundation of the Medical College of Georgia—the remains of illegal medical experimentation occurring at the university between 1835 and 1912. It was discovered that most of the bodies were stolen from an African American burial ground. As Harriet A. Washington explains in Medical Apartheid, “For blacks, anatomical dissection…was an extension of slavery into eternity, because it represented a profound level of white control over their bodies, illustrating that they were not free even in death.” Washington also points out that, “Such exploitation of the dead was hardly limited to the South. Most of the bodies used by New York City’s Columbia University and New York University were from the Negros Burying Ground. In 1712 and again in 1741, New York slave rebellions were actuated in part by the refusal of slave owners to allow slaves to bury their dead.”\r\n\r\nRochelle Goldberg’s Dead Pan Fish Revival, 2016, presents a ceramic fish head on steel delineation of a pan. The surface of the fish head is dark, black, and slick, as if it is the remains of a tragic oil spill, such as the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill that poured 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s Prince William sound in a matter of hours. Goldberg’s work finds the tension between fish as a resource and fish as a creature. The exaggerated scale of both the severed head and pan animates the corpse from the position of consumed to that of a potential consumer. Resting in its eye socket is an eight ball, referencing the magic 8 ball toy oracle that gives statistically improbable answers even if a precise question has been asked.\r\n\r\nCatharine Czudej’s Trap 5, 2016, is inspired by weapons designed and utilized by the Viet Cong and Rat Trap 1, 2017 is inspired by early 20th century American rat traps. The latter are collected as Americana— nostalgic ephemera that portrays an idealized life of gritty small town America from 1880 to the First World War. Czudej’s structures idolize substantial un-maned defenses from scrap and crude engineering. Her sculptures point to the group psychology of a prolonged hunt on a global scale and the aftermath of a uniquely American style of cultural maiming.\r\n\r\nIn Untitled (Casual Power), 2015, Juliana Huxtable gives an ecstatic description of New York. She leaves breadcrumbs for specific places, events, and people—Harlem, the area along the Bronx River, the Hoover administration, Octavia Butler, Left Eye—but resists a single narrative. Huxtable recently described her stance on writing poetry, “I like the alternative idea of a schizophrenic voice: one that can’t reside with any stability in the first person, third person, and so on, and that doesn’t even permit a predictable relationship between subject and verb. You’re jumping between persons, switching characters and exploding history into a play place. Allowing myself space for that mode of writing and thinking to happen is a more honest and dynamic reflection of how I’m processing the world.”\r\n\r\nSam McKinniss’s paintings feature earnest portrayals of celebrities, shuffling well-known figures from popular culture into so-called high art scenarios. Ellie Sattler, 2017, features Laura Dern as the beloved paleobotanist from the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park in which a commercial site of leisure is transformed into a site of terror. McKinniss’s affiliation with, or rather his affection for Dern is best expressed in the baroque wistfulness of her character’s khaki pleated shorts as depicted and perhaps exaggerated here. McKinniss reminds us that the popular icon of our not so distant past may be worthy of faithful veneration, redistribution into camp, or redramatization.\r\n\r\nElaine Cameron-Weir’s Lamp, 2016 features used laboratory hardware rigged into the support structure of an incense burning apparatus. A tilted motorcycle mirror simultaneously doubles and provides another vantage point of this operation with an almost perverse ‘upskirt’ specificity of focus on the flames contact with the burning material. A neon squiggle, also affixed with laboratory clamps, casts an icy blue glow on the action, giving it the air of sci-fi. All of these elements are adjustable and easily recognized as such: knobs, nuts, threaded rods, exposed cords. These seemingly provisional elements are the result of a DIY design and problem solving akin to the kind used in Czudej’s installations, but with a particularly meticulous aesthetic, as though they had been written about or described previously in great detail. Indeed, Cameron-Weir has spoken about using writing as a way to ‘sketch’ her work, often beginning with the mood or tone evoked by writing fiction. Despite the obvious specificity of the details in Cameron-Weir’s installations, they conjure a time in history that seems both of the past and of some imagined future, of a hoped-for beauty and a dystopian possibility.\r\n\r\nAnna Betbeze’s dyed and burned works made with flokati rugs have been understood by some as a highly formal painting practice, but to constrain them to those terms alone would be to neglect the sense of touch that the works evoke, as well as the suggestive meaning of using a found support. Like Cameron-Weir, Betbeze’s works are highly sensual, she describes this experience as “when seeing becomes breathing, stroking, tasting, and sound—often simultaneously.” Included here is a new body of work made from wooden vessels that have been burned and transformed into charcoal. The charred black vessels retain their wood grain and the scent from burning, allowing their history to be sensed as well as seen.\r\n\r\nLiz Craft’s sculptures make reference to 1970s counterculture in America, encasing ceramic mushrooms, tiles, and lit candle sticks within modern day text message bubbles. These works question the logic of language, confounding the very building blocks of history. Like those central to Terence McKenna’s ‘Stoned Ape’ theory, mushrooms are catalysts for heightened communication, boundary dissolution, and harmonious societies.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hawkins was raised on a farm in Kentucky in the early 1900s and learned to draw by copying illustrations from horse-auction announcements and calendar pictures. When he was twenty-one, he moved to Columbus, Ohio, but it wasn’t until the late 1970s that Hawkins began making the paintings of cityscapes and fantastic animals that he is most known for today. Hawkins once said that he drew “for all the young people in United States.” Hawkins is often described within the category of “outsider art” because he had a third grade education, but the terms fails to acknowledge how the education system neglected and neglects certain people due to their race, class, or financial position. Untitled (Snake), 1990, is a Loch Ness monster, rendered in enamel house paint and it features Hawkins’s traditional signature: his name and the date and location of his birth."

Concluding more than two years of work, research, and experience, Radical Hospitality is an investigation of the stranger, of place, and of interactions on the edge. The multimedia installation presents a 1.5-hour abstract film shot over 30 days throughout the Mediterranean, into the Middle East, across Western Europe and up to the Arctic Circle. An itinerant with only a camera, Simone’s eye documents the experience of unsolicited hospitality in these cultures often labeled as hostile in current Western discourse.\r\n \r\nInstalled in the basement of IDIO Gallery, the art space that Simone has held open for the last two years, the public is radically hosted for the equivalent 30 days straight. Video immerses the viewer; boulder-like sculptures covered in carpets receive the body; and an array of instruments provide creative (or destructive) interaction. From sunrise to sunset, the space will be open to the Absolute Other, to any stranger, to do as they please. In a time of fractured reality, when 65 million are forcibly displaced worldwide, radical hospitality is an experiment in the relinquishing of power. It is a creative response to our shared state of strangeness. At every level, from consciousness to body, native to citizen, guest to host, we cross the threshold at the edge and meet ourselves when we meet the strange. \r\n \r\nThis installation is the participatory step in a long-form conceptual art piece, where the guest becomes host. Will this experience of radical hospitality engender the same reaction in its guests, to be shared in turn?\r\n\r\nAudio recorded during the installation will be compiled and added to the film as its score, to be published as such."

We are especially pleased to present awards to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of this important competition that brings the art of emerging and under-recognized artists to the attention of museum curators.\r\n\r\nThe competition selection as always was difficult, but especially so for the nature of art in our world today encompasses a wide variety of methods, materials and conceptualizations of what art is. And there were so many outstanding submissions. \r\nMore than 550 artists submitted over 2000 submissions, a daunting task, but Susan Thompson, who juried this year’s competition, did an outstanding job.\r\n\r\nIn her curatorial statement Ms. Thompson states “In reviewing the diverse pool of entrants, I found that I was most compelled by the artists who were pushing the boundaries of their selected medium and created works that were slightly unsettling. In some cases, this meant new, unusual, or surprising use of materials. In other works, this was reflected in strange or disquieting compositions. Many of the artists made fruitful use of unique combinations of color, texture, pattern, or imagery, often using collage to create generative juxtapositions. All are wholly original in their point of view. I am most grateful for the opportunity to review the work of so many impassioned creators and congratulate the winners and finalists on their selection for the exhibition.”\r\n\r\nAs always, Viridian makes an effort to expand the opportunities for outstanding art to be seen and exhibited. Consequently, the gallery Director’s Choices will also be viewable in digital form. At a later date, we hope to exhibit their actual art. We feel it important to tangibly demonstrate that curatorial choice is often as much about personal taste as it is about the “quality” of the art for “quality” in art is often open to opinion.\r\n\r\n“Director’s Choice” \r\nto be presented digitally\r\n\r\n~ Andrew Amundson ~ Justin Archer ~ Suzanne Barton ~ Ellen Burnett ~ MinSeok Chi ~ Ashley Comer ~ Susan Copich ~ DeShaun Craddock ~ Kim Curinga ~ Edgardo Dander ~ Matthew Derezinski ~ Santiago Echeverry ~ Kate Holcomb Hale ~ Terry Hastings ~ Charles Hildebrandt ~ Jim Jacobs ~ Aaron Kalinay ~ Youngho Kang ~ Katy Mixon ~ Yuko Mizobuchi ~ Aimee Perez ~ Lou Peterson ~ Aya Ogasawara ~ Holly Wilson ~"

          "Next to Nothing presents Premonitions, an exhibition of new and historical work from two noted New York City artists, Rick Prol and Juan Eduardo Gomez. \r\n￼￼￼\r\nPremonitions will feature recent paintings by Rick Prol as well as a selection of works on paper dating from 1991 in which he established the foundation of his visual language of symbols and metaphors. Juan Eduardo Gomez’s paintings and works on paper explore the rich terrain between figurative and abstract work employing his own emotional and personal symbols.\r\n\r\nAbout the Artists:\r\nRick Prol\r\nProl was born and raised in NYC where he currently lives and works. His work exemplifies and helped define with “anarchical impudence” the more dangerous and harrowing aspects of urban reality with images both horrific and absurd, with a touch of humor. Prol’s aesthetic employs Art Brut Expressionism to convey images of human folly and suffering in a variety of media including the paintings in this exhibition. Prol’s work is in many private and public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, NYC, the Guggenheim Museum, NYC, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Contemporary Museum of Art, Chicago, Holocaust Museum, Washington DC, Smithsonian Libraries Collection, Washington DC, Hirshhorn Museum &amp; Sculpture Garden, Washington DC, Ackland Art Museum and University of North Carolina Larry Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, CT.\r\n\r\nJuan Eduardo Gomez\r\nI came to The United States to be an artist. I left a culture of oppression and violence that was prevalent at the time in Colombia. I realized that by allowing myself to be free, I could thank and celebrate the people and the places that welcomed me.\r\nIn paintings, I like the use of emotional and personal subject matter.\r\nJuan Eduardo Gómez is an American artist born in Colombia. Gomez left his country in 1989 to study art and found a new home in New York City, where he can practice his devotion to the art of painting. He received a BFA in Fine Arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 1998. Gomez received The Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award for painting from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007. Gomez paintings are in the permanent collections of the High Museum of Art , Atlanta, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Colby Museum of Art, Waterville, ME, Hispanic Society of America NYC, Bowdoin College Museum of Art Brunswick, ME and Dikeou Collection, Denver.\r\n"

          "Thomas Erben Gallery presents Painting in due time, a group exhibition of multistylistic and intergenerational painters. In the works of Scott Anderson, Lydia Dona, Denzil Hurley, Harriet Korman, Hanneline Røgeberg, and Marcus Weber, the materials, techniques, and conventions of painting give way to new experimentation, where extended viewing is rewarded with vibrant and surprising effects.\r\n\r\nIn Harriet Korman’s works (b. 1947, Bridgeport, CT), an impression of pure geometry gives way to complex, painterly constructions. Untitled (1979) depicts a plane of color fields, their rolling outlines suggesting a lying figure. Upon closer inspection, the seemingly flat colors are understood as lightly feathered and beautifully textured, with subtle layers of pigment built up in a delicate evolution. This understated technique is similarly present in Untitled (2014), a canvas dominated by a geometric form integrated within a white ground. Rectangular shapes with heavily saturated colors recall the aesthetics of hard edge painting, but the soft brush handling complicates this reference, with loosely drawn crosses scarring the even surfaces. Over time the areas appear to conflict, as Korman’s penchant for surface and attention to edges dramatize the play of colors.\r\n\r\nUsing gesture to upturn expectation is a technique similarly present in the work of Lydia Dona (b. 1955, Bucharest). In a work like Movement-Image and Molecular Memories (1995), Dona’s canvas centers on a large pink orb, painted in an even, flat tone. This form is, however, constructed from the background; it is given shape through the superimposed ornamentation that arcs around the picture. In these scratchy, looping, coral-like forms, Dona employs the flattened aesthetics and unmodulated colors of printmaking to animate the painted surface. In the lower left corner seep in mechanical parts that recall Marcel Duchamp’s Large Glass, suggesting Dona’s interest in using the conflict  between schematic and gestural elements as a productive engine for her work. Golden Blasting into the Urban Tissue (2017) incorporates these strategies as well, where a pale yellow field is subsumed in interlocking linear elements and wild, flowing masses of pigment.\r\n\r\nIn the Field (2017), a diptych by Hanneline Røgeberg (b. 1963, Oslo), presents two canvases linked by their content as well as by her process. Each work depicts a single site at different points in time, and overlaid on top, the artist paints an additional outline that is impressed from one onto the other. This slippage between images is central to the artist’s work, as there is often political significance to the historical sites she depicts. In enacting a transfer between the two surfaces, Røgeberg treats the images as a form of language or memory code that can be re-used, translated, or taken up by ideology. The partial cover-up of the image reflects this distrust, and the fact that its meanings can be inverted. In another large-scale work, Lede (2015), this haziness is given a more autonomous form, with layers of paint overlapping one another in a washy, though material fog of blues and lavenders.\r\n\r\nUsing fragmented pictorial spaces, Scott Anderson’s (b. 1973, Urbana, IL) work unifies disparate representational references. A canvas like Adult Contemporary (2016) conveys the breadth of Anderson’s references, as he pulls from various images, styles, and periods. Multiple images appear to overlap in a refracted, gemlike space, out of which moments become legible. Cartoon-like faces and profiles populate the work, their features rendered in soft color and light strokes. At the center of the work floats an ambiguous symbol: a bisected cube, pierced with a circle. The distinction between line and volume, surface and flatness, and description and nondescription is alternatively negotiated and collapsed. These visual ambivalences run through Webber vs. Sous - Vide (2017) too, where blocks of red and green clash and vibrate, echoing the gestural turmoil of the work’s content.\r\n\r\nMarcus Weber’s (b. 1965, Stuttgart) paintings portray urban spaces, focusing on their function as complex, social sites. With their bright color and cartoonish forms, the works show iconic elements of city planning – squares, parks, streets – overtaken by masses of blocky figures. In his heavily applied paints, Weber caricatures various personas, pulling cyclists, women with strollers, birds and dogs as well as joggers into layered, geometric surfaces. The angular compositions emphasize these elaborately patterned forms, drawing attention to the beautifully textured brushwork. The grace of this handling is often in contrast to the subjects themselves, who are often reduced into flat marks, or grotesque lumps. In F-Hain (2010), for example, two walking figures have grotesquely shaped, sculpturally modeled heads that appear impossibly heavy. In the foreground, a ghostly type, wearing the signature cap of an ETA terrorist, is depicted with a pure white face and bright red eyes.\r\n\r\nDenzil Hurley (b. 1949, Barbados), in two oil on linen constructions to which poles have been attached, produces paintings that are reduced bare until they point beyond themselves. In Blue Glyph #1 (2011-12), four narrow painted elements are fastened into a rectangular window, each painted a monochromatic blue. An inserted pole hangs downwards, echoing the form of a street sign. The work Yellow Glyph #2 (2016-17) uses a similar format, colored instead with a richly saturated yellow. Despite hinting at the conventions of the monochrome and assembled canvases, the works unite themselves to form frames that privilege the wall behind, and the space underneath. In addition to this frame, their pose suggests signals designed for common usage, treating these glyphs as open messages that can be taken up and carried outwards"

          "BRIDGES is a solo exhibition of work by noted Brooklyn-based artist Sam Messer. The exhibition reveals the breadth of Messer’s body of work and includes large-scale paintings of New York City’s iconic bridges, portrait drawings, and animated videos from Messer’s Years of the Cock, comprised of one video made daily in response to President Trump’s first 100 days in office. While the Years of the Cock videos provide trenchant commentary on politics of the moment, for Messer, the bridges have both physical and metaphorical appeal: “They are succinct and quite beautiful, and bring people together,” he explains.\r\n\r\nMesser is an artist best known for his sustained series of paintings in collaboration with writers like Paul Auster,  Jonathan Safran Foer, and Denis Johnson. If this body of work represents a departure for Messer, it is above all, a turn to the political—a desire to focus his artistic talents on responding to our current political climate. The pieces in this exhibition are varied: paintings of New York’s bridges, sketches of a wide range of people in Messer’s sphere, a series of video animations on the Trump presidency, and evocations of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. The through line? A desire to speak about community, democracy and embracing humanity.”\r\n\r\nSam Messer received a B.F.A. from Cooper Union in 1976 and an M.F.A. from Yale University in 1982. He is represented by Nielsen Gallery, Boston, and Shoshana Wayne Gallery, Los Angeles. His work may be found in public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Art Institute of Chicago, and Yale University Art Gallery. Mr. Messer has received awards including a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant in 1984, the Engelhard Award in 1985, a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant in 1993, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1996. He has recently collaborated with Paul Auster on The Story of My Typewriter, and with Denis Johnson on Cloud of Chalk. He was appointed senior critic at Yale in 1994 and in 2005 was appointed associate dean and professor (adjunct). He also serves as director of the art division of the Yale Summer School of Music and Art in Norfolk.\r\n"

          "David Armacost\r\nKatherine Bradford\r\nEJ Hauser\r\nYevgeniya Baras\r\nJohn Finneran\r\nGuillermo Kuitca\r\nMichael Berryhill\r\nHeather Guertin\r\nRyan McLaughlin\r\n \r\n \r\nSperone Westwater presents Pictography, a group exhibition of paintings posing as ideograms. The exhibition intends to convey a mood rather than a hypothesis, exploring aspects of a pictographic turn in painting. At times these works seem to acknowledge the pervasiveness of digital screens. Others appear overtly archaic or totemic in cast, as if to emphasize their non-digital nature, whether in facture or in esoteric subject matter. Throughout, the works behave as text or read as thought-pictures, like cartoons of ideas. Subjecting motifs to distillation and transformation, these artists suggest that long-discarded Modernist notions about painting as text (or sign) might have mileage in them yet.\r\n \r\nWriting assumes a constitutive role in the work of EJ Hauser, who churns out sketches in sessions called “drawing labs;” she hopes to preserve their immediate graphic qualities in her paintings. In Hauser’s work text jostles against image and motifs which appear to be drawn from nature might depict poignant phrases rather than actual landscapes. (A visitor to Hauser’s studio suggested the phrase “crown mountain tunnel,” which has since become a recurring motif, in response to one of her works.) Paintings called “lookers” or “watchers” merge a mountainous landscape with a large Gustonesque head. The glyph-like framework of the head allows the image to flicker, over successive renderings, between the solidity of a boulder and the transparency of a window.\r\n \r\nIn the work of Ryan McLaughlin, writing softens into the pictorial. The iconic elements of his work recall Marsden Hartley’s military paintings of heraldic signs (which are, it should be noted, “portraits”). Here an untitled work features the shape of a bull, emblazoned with a white cross which could stand for Switzerland as readily as for any number of logos. The softly tactile application of paint elides the personal and the corporate.\r\n \r\nYevgeniya Baras creates richly textured paintings in which scrolling Russian script props up and squeezes between the work’s main compositional elements. These characters seem to become untethered from their linguistic associations. Curling lines rhyme with the flowing script, and a reading of the work shifts readily between its explicit textual qualities and its suggestion of a figure.\r\n \r\nHeather Guertin’s work is not exactly portraiture, but it derives its emotional charge from this misapprehension. A small painting carves a face out of an oval Tiepolo sky with the faintest suggestion of a profile, while a large painting of crisp, mirrored heads produces a shallow space like a frieze. In John Finneran’s work, the body similarly splits into its signifying features: eyes, limbs, hieratic figures elongated across the picture plane. These works mine the narrow gap between iconic and three-dimensional space, between graphic and painterly line.\r\n \r\nGuillermo Kuitca and David Armacost each employ architectural motifs to stand in for a wide array of concerns. In Kuitca’s work, putatively rational documents (floorplans, maps) become bodily surrogates or spaces where the psychological intrudes on the bureaucratic. One work conflates route markings with outstretched limbs, another a cubistoid floorplan with a body. In Armacost’s work, a stage becomes a veiled figural presence, alternately suggesting a spotlit head and a darkened curtain beaded with eyes.\r\n \r\nMichael Berryhill’s paintings often feature an ambiguous central figure, elaborately staged. A recent work dissolves this form into a loose tangle of what might be greenery or drapery. The work reads as both Matissean pattern and runic symbol. Figure and ground invert and revert without clear resolution.\r\n \r\nIn a recent painting by Katherine Bradford, a figure barely weighted down by his necktie seems to wrangle with a Janus-like emanation which could be his double. The scene registers as archaic shorthand for a mythological episode, as if cave paintings depicted case studies in contemporary psychology.\r\n"

          "Anthony Philip Fine Art presents “A More Human Dwelling Place,” an exhibition of new relief sculptures by Bob Clyatt.  The exhibition will be on display from June 30 through July 30, 2017. View the catalogue online here.\r\n\r\n“A More Human Dwelling Place” examines the modern landscapes of our culture, iconography, and social discourse through a series of high relief wall sculptures. These pieces strive to present an unfiltered prism through which the viewer can see our world and contemporary issues distilled down to their basic questions, hopefully unburdening them from their own egocentric experiences and encouraging a holistic perspective.\r\n\r\nBob Clyatt’s reliefs eschew the quick reveal, instead encouraging in-depth engagement through contemplative viewings. These reliefs permit meditation and reflection; they also challenge us to question our own implicit responsibility to and for our circumstances without moralizing.\r\n\r\nClyatt’s work has been included in the permanent collections of a number of prestigious collections including Buffalo’s Burchfield Penney Museum and The Contemporary Art Museum of Sicily in Catania. This is his second solo New York exhibition and first in Bushwick, Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a special evening public viewing for the galleries of 56 Bogart on Friday July 21, from 6-9.\r\n\r\n "

          "Ordered Dance brings together works from three contemporary artists who utilize and investigate manmade systems as part of their practices. This desired constellation could be seen as an atemporal interplay of mechanical and natural.\r\n \r\nMonira Al Qadiri’s ‘Travel Prayer’ juxtaposes footage of camel race with a voice reading a traditional travel prayer. Because of laws in Saudi Arabia prohibiting the use of children as camel jockeys, each camel is outfitted with a small remote-controlled whipping machine on their back. The pain of the majestic animal is reflected in its face and movement, as it is running aimlessly towards oblivion.\r\n \r\nMonira Al Qadiri is a Kuwaiti visual artist born in Senegal and educated in Japan. In 2010, she received a Ph.D. in inter-media art from Tokyo University of the Arts, where her research was focused on the aesthetics of sadness in the Middle East stemming from poetry, music, art and religious practices. Her work explores unconventional gender identities, petro-cultures and their possible futures, as well as the legacies of corruption. She is also part of the artist collective GCC.\r\n \r\nBirk Marcus Hansen’s series of flags is dedicated to Europa, the smallest of Jupiter’s four Galilean moons. Since the dawn of time, Earth has been shaped by huge migrations. Now that mankind has ventured into space, however, our future may lie beyond our own planet. What might be an appropriate design for a flag representing a geographic area outside Earth’s atmosphere?\r\n\r\nWith a passion for graphic design and video art, Birk Marcus Hansen’s (born in Denmark, based in Amsterdam, Netherlands) working process typically has a heavy emphasis on research, history and symbolism. Among the topics that inspire him are technological advances, geopolitics and history. His work often takes a speculative approach, and he likes to employ fiction as a framework that lets him tweak and investigate, combine and challenge key concepts, ideas and trends in contemporary society.\r\n\r\nIn Gray Tank, Inspection, Theodore Sefcik has combined his distinctive hand-drawn designs and physics-based animation tools with new color processing techniques. The result is a richly textured window into an artificial world teeming with life. The presentation offers a dreamy journey through a menagerie of primordial machines, jumbo bacteria, dangling amphibians, and floating garbage.\r\n \r\nTheodore Sefcik is a New York-based artist known for his enigmatic animations, which combine the aesthetics of primitive computer graphics with early color video art. Presented on atypical, repurposed screens, his videos range from scenes of organic body-horror to inscrutable assembly lines and humanoid dancers. Sefcik’s videos and glitched AI-assisted digital photographs have been exhibited in solo and group shows in New York and Stockholm. Sefcik also performs original compositions, songs and spoken word pieces as RAXTSFK.  \r\n \r\nCurator Bio:\r\n \r\nIlari Laamanen is a curator residing in New York City with a focus on interdisciplinary projects. Recent curatorial work includes ‘Momentum 9 Biennial’ in Moss, Norway (2017) and ‘fashion after Fashion’ at the Museum of Arts and Design, New York (2017). \r\n"

        "Description": [
          "Keep It Alive is an exhibition of Alan Vega’s final work, a suite of haunting large-scale paintings he had completed just before his death in July, 2016.\r\n\r\nThe paintings, each composed of a central figure (often disfigured, deformed, or viewed askance) and presented against an obscured and chaotic backdrop, are an extension of the small-scale, serial pencil-and-paper portraiture that Vega produced nightly for over three decades. As paintings, they represent, too, a full-circle return for Vega who began his career as a painting student of Ad Reinhardt and Kurt Seligmann, then moved away from canvas towards sculpture and drawing and music, coming back to the medium, at the very end of his life, after working back through drawing and sculpture again.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition also features three of Vega’s iconic light-based sculptures, alongside the figure-based paintings. “They all look different but they’re all basically me and facets of my personality,” he once said of his obsessive focus on depicting distorted male figures.  “I’ve always drawn old men, even when I was a young kid. I used to go out to the Bowery and draw these old guys. Always done while I’m blitzed. Never touch them straight. I write like that, too. Some things come out of me that would never come out of me straight. Never. The sculptures I would never do any other way but straight. That’s dangerous shit, man.”\r\n\r\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1938, Vega is known first as one-half of the groundbreaking electro-punk duo Suicide, which initiated the merger of adversarial rock and anti-establishment performance that became punk, even as it left the movement behind. But music was always Vega’s second act. At Brooklyn College, he became involved with the activist collective Art Worker’s Coalition, which lobbied aggressively for museum reform and even barricaded MoMA, and with the Project of Living Artists, an anarcho-residency-performance space which emerged from it. He moved from painting to sculptures assembled from light fixtures and discarded electronic detritus, works which critic Simon Reynolds described  “trash-culture shrines from a post-cataclysmic America of the near-future” and Jeffrey Deitch has called “the toughest and most radical art I had ever seen.” Vega staged several legendary shows at OK Harris Gallery, and later inaugurated Barbara Gladstone’s first downtown space in 1983. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Vega continued to make new work, but declined to exhibit it until 2002.\r\n\r\nWhen Alan Vega’s death was announced by Henry Rollins in the summer of 2016, it seemed as if all of New York was in mourning. Outpourings of love were spray-painted on brick walls, record store sandwich boards cried out for an era lost, and music lovers and downtown doyennes recounted stories of a time that once was.\r\n\r\nPhoto credit: Ari Marcopoulos"

          "Danziger Gallery presents its first exhibition of photographs by Ed Templeton and the artist’s first photography show in New York.\r\n \r\nA California native, Templeton grew up and still lives in the suburbs of Orange County. His photographs tell the story of the worlds he knows – the pangs and passion of youth, the beauty and tackiness of Southern California, and the exhilaration and exhaustion of the skateboard world he starred in.\r\n \r\nWhile Templeton originally gained fame as a skateboarder, turning professional in 1990 and founding his own skateboard company, he always felt a need for creative expression both athletically and artistically. Influenced by professional skateboarders who did their own graphics and art, Templeton began to create works in multiple mediums – painting, photography, and sculpture. He continued to tour the world as a skateboarder, but over time (and injury), his art became his primary focus.\r\n \r\nAround 1994 Templeton had become associated with a group of west coast artists whose styles and distribution channels originated largely outside of the art world, and included an interest in pop culture iconography, a commitment to be true and unpretentious, and a strong do-it-yourself attitude.\r\n \r\nCollectively titled “Beautiful Losers” the group included Shepard Fairey, Mark Gonzales, Margaret Kilgallen, Barry McGee, and Ryan McGinley among others and was documented in an influential film, book, and touring exhibition.\r\n \r\nWhile Templeton’s photography is entirely self-taught, it would be a mistake to label him an outsider artist. He is well aware of what he is doing, the intricacies of his craft, and the moment to press the shutter. Think of a young Lartigue growing up in a working class family in SoCal as opposed to a rich cosmopolitan milieu.\r\n \r\nTempleton documents the people and places he encounters in a rich stream of images - of himself and his wife Deanna, of the everyday people who hang out at Huntington Beach, and the places he passes in his car. He collects images of themes that he feels drawn to – teen smokers and kissers; surfers and skaters; public displays of religion, politics and self-expression.\r\n \r\nTempleton likes to present his photographs in a non-hierarchical manner, large quantities mixed up together in irregular clusters. He hangs works in the shape of what he calls “image clouds.” In Templeton’s way of seeing we recognize the fascination of the passer-by gripped at some unexpected moment by the “extraordinary of the ordinary”, the exceptional and existential moments of daily life. It’s the best and truest tradition of photography – always ready to surprise when a new voice or vision looks at the world afresh with the same old Leica.\r\n \r\nEd Templeton’s work is regularly exhibited at museums around the world. A mid-career survey of his work entitled The Cemetery of Reason traveled throughout Europe from 2010 to 2011. Publications of his work include ten monographs and his many self-published zines. His work has been shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles; Palais de Tokyo, Paris; S.M.A.K. Museum, Belgium; Bonnefanten Museum, Holland; and the Kunsthalle, Vienna.\r\n "

          "Condo New York\r\nLabor, Mexico City\r\nHosted by GBE\r\n\r\nThe title for this show comes from a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. The Argentine writer describes a sorcerer who has installed himself in the burnt-out ruins of the temple to an ancient fire god, where he attempts to dream a human life into being. Borges’s story is a reflection on the conditions of consciousness and creativity, as well as on time and the changeful nature of the universe. Each of the artists shown here likewise engages these themes in complex, evocative ways.\r\n\r\nNicholas Mangan’s A World Undone (2012), for example, combines the millisecond-long intervals into which video technology chops time with geological time scales of billions of years. In so doing, he helps to unseat, even if only fleetingly, the way we tend perceive time, both as a result of the capitalist world-system into which we were all born and, more profoundly, as a result of our biological makeup. In different ways, both Antonio Vega Macotela’s Studies of Exhaustion: Study No. 3, The Flesh (2013) and Étienne Chambaud’s Nameless (2014) reprise these themes. Vega Macotela mobilizes the resources of artistic production to return us to a crucial historical moment in the stitching-together of the world-system: namely, when heralds of early modern capitalism in Europe first encountered the untold wealth of the New World, and devised an apparatus that would enable that wealth to flow to Europe. With such mills of blood, the labor time of capital was introduced to the indigenous populations of the Americas. Meanwhile, Chambaud pursues the links between different biological beings, territoriality and meaning by staging chemical reactions on canvas. Using animal lures and oxidizable metals, he produces a set of visual traces that human spectators will be able to perceive.\r\nPablo Vargas Lugo and Gala Porras-Kim confront us with experiences of indecipherability on an intercultural scale. In Vargas Lugo’s MS1131 (H) (Anamorphosis) (2014), Mayan calligraphy is transported through time and across media, thereby interposing additional layers of sense to be interpreted. The drawings in Porras-Kim’s For Prospective Rock/Artifact Projection (2014) also engage with a pre-Hispanic writing system, but her attention is focused on the fuzzy line that separates geological processes of physical transformation from human ones.\r\n\r\nThe final three pieces of the show take a more conceptual turn by reconfiguring our notions of space and time themselves. Distance, in Katinka Bock’s Pacific — Atlantic (2016), is not a matter of comparing static geographical locations or of the actual extension between two points\r\nin space, but an intensive series realized through color and symmetry. Chambaud’s SET (2017) takes the French poet Stéphane Mallarmé’s famous affirmation that “a throw of the dice will never abolish chance” and pushes it even further by crystallizing such “throws” in static sculptural forms. Jerónimo Elespe’s oil paintings on aluminum (2017) close the show by connecting the themes of chance, the layering of meaning, geological sedimentation, and disparate timescales. Built up, layer by layer, through a nonlinear process of accumulation, these paintings remind us of the inescapable fullness of time —not only on the Earth’s timescale of billions of years, but on the more prosaic scale of days, weeks and months."

          "DARE you see a soul at the white heat?\r\nThen crouch within the door.\r\nRed is the fire’s common tint;\r\nBut when the vivid ore\r\nHas sated flame’s conditions,\r\nIts quivering substance plays\r\nWithout a color but the light\r\nOf unanointed blaze.\r\nLeast village boasts its blacksmith,\r\nWhose anvil’s even din\r\nStands symbol for the finer forge\r\nThat soundless tugs within,\r\nRefining these impatient ores\r\nWith hammer and with blaze,\r\nUntil the designated light\r\nRepudiate the forge.\r\n\r\nEmily Dickinson – Part One: Life – XXXIII\r\n\r\nFeaturing the works of Damien Hirst, Enrico Castellani, Tim Rollins and K.O.S., Nicole Eisenman, Robert Barry, Doug Argue, Mario Garcia Torres, Antonio Santin, Fernanda Gomes, Jong Oh, Jeanne Silverthorne, Liliane Tomasko, Otis Jones, Liang Shaoji, Chris Jones, Han Jinsu, Mark Hagen, Andrew Kuo, Katherine Mangiardi, John L Moore, Taizo Kuroda, Nicolás Guagnini, Todd Norsten, Robert C. Morgan, Joan Levinson, Todd Murphy\r\n\r\nMARC STRAUS presents THE WHITE HEAT, an exhibition of white paintings and sculptures by an international selection of artists. THE WHITE HEAT, a title derived from Emily Dickinson’s Life poem, is an exhibition that focuses on purity – an uninflected surface, a clarity of thought or an instance of sheer concentrated artistic intensity. Dickinson’s “soul at the white heat”."

          "Enterprising Machines are works inspired by machine aesthetics that reference common tools and domestic utilitarian objects. Gondek’s process begins with digital manipulations from original consumer catalogs published in the early 1900’s for Pratt and Whitney tools, and the Enterprise Manufacturing Company, maker of domestic gadgets. The digitally printed elements Gondek composes recall blueprints or plans, and create a foundation for the modiﬁcation of the context of these implements."

The femme fatale, illicit lust, and animalistic movements swirl in a web that call attention to our own complicity in the blaming and shaming of female sexuality. In doing so, she asks and answers the question, how can sexualized representations of the female body be used to contradict systemic patriarchal objectification without perpetuating it?\r\n\r\nArtist talk: July 30th at 6:30pm"

          "Mrs. presents Three’s Company, with works by Rebecca Morgan, Mark Mulroney and Montgomery Perry Smith.  As the title implies, the artists included utilize similar devices and share commonalities throughout their practices aligning with the popular comedy-of-errors sitcom, Three’s Company; which celebrated the clashing personalities, everyday misunderstandings and sexual tensions of a cast of unlikely roommates.    \r\n\r\nIn the program’s first episode, which aired on ABC in 1977, roommates Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow unexpectedly find stranger, Jack Tripper passed out in their bathtub after a lively and drunken party.  In need of a new roommate, the women hastily offer him a space in the apartment, using the pretense that Jack (who is straight) is homosexual, to circumvent the landlord Stanley Roper’s intolerance for co-ed living situations.\r\n\r\nThe humor in Three’s Company, is primarily based on farce and overt innuendo, as many of the series’ running jokes are established upon Jack’s fictitious sexual orientation.  Physical comedy punctuates the trio’s hare-brained schemes to remedy their drama-filled situations and self-created comedic dilemmas. In parallel, Morgan, Mulroney and Smith’s works perform as stand-ins for the sitcom’s characters.  Not one identifying as a specific role, but each encompassing improbable personalities, comedic gestures and satiric portrayals.\r\n\r\nHailing from Central Pennsylvania, Rebecca Morgan’s paintings, drawings and ceramics emanate from stereotypes of rural Appalachia. Humorous, benevolent (and savage at turns) her characters touch on truths about poverty, addiction, off-the-grid living, as well as idealizations of uncultured country life. Stylistically, Morgan embraces hyper-detailed naturalism, influenced by Dutch painters such as Memling, Brueghel, and Van Eyck, as well as absurd, repulsive caricatures suggestive of underground artists such as R.Crumb and Tom of Finland.  As an on-and-off-again New Yorker, Morgan represents the ultimate insider/outsider point-of view, embracing and critically distancing herself from her origins.\r\n\r\nMark Mulroney’s works stem from a familiar nostalgia for comic books and Saturday morning cartoons. Situated between humor and art, pop culture and silliness, Mulroney’s work is playful, comical and exquisitely crafted.  In these most recent works, Mulroney has simplified comic book covers and scenes from such, down to their most rudimentary and abstracted forms and colors.  Effie Bowen in 2013 stated, “Mulroney provides levity in an art universe choking with sober academia. Depending on your mental state at the time, any piece could cause an onslaught of laughter or of tears. His playful inventiveness acts as a flashback to youthful fantasies fraught with appendageal obsessions and a reveling in cartoon gore and guts… his art conjures memories of a less media driven existence, while providing twisted amusement.”\r\n\r\nMontgomery Perry Smith’s work combines portions of domestic furniture and fixtures, decorative textiles and fake flowers in the creation of wall mounted and suspended sculptures. His over embellished forms are often orifice, portal, flower and reliquary at once, resulting in objects that hover between performance, sci-fi beast, rare organic growths and sexual innuendo.\r\nRebecca Morgan received a BA from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania and her MFA from Pratt Institute, NY.  She is the recipient of a residency at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, The Watershed Center for Ceramic Arts Residency, a Vermont Studio Center full fellowship, and the George Rickey Residency at Yaddo. Exhibitions include Vancouver Art Gallery, Canada, Asya Geisberg, NY Invisible Exports, NY, Honey Ramka, NY, Arts KC, MO, Booth Gallery, NY, Gasser Grunert Gallery, NY, Richard Heller Gallery, Los Angeles, CA and Vox Populi Gallery, PA among others.\r\n\r\nMark Mulroney received a BFA from San Diego State University and an MFA in Studio Arts from University of California at Santa Barbara.  Recent exhibitions include Park Life Gallery, CA, Ampersand Gallery, OR, CG2 Gallery, TN, Mixed Greens, NY, Joshua Liner, NY, EverGold, CA, Left Field Gallery, CA and Slow Culture, CA.  This is his first time exhibiting with Mrs.  Mulroney lives and works in Syracuse, NY.\r\n\r\nMontgomery Perry Smith is a sculptor and performance artist residing in Brooklyn, NY. He holds a BFA with a focus on Fiber and Material Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  Exhibitions include, The Bureau of General Services - Queer Division, NY,  Roots and Culture, IL, Halsted Gallery, IL, Grace Exhibition Space, NY, David B. Smith Gallery, CO, among others.  Smith is also a well known drag performer under the stage name Patti Spliff.  "

          "What is the “site” of knowledge? Is it a book? A library? An artwork? Or a concept? What is the visual shape or the image of knowledge? And when does a symbol become a pictorial composition, a line drawing, a word or a concept? How do we attach meaning to a line?\r\n\r\nJane Lombard Gallery presents Sites of Knowledge, a group exhibition curated by the collaborative Re-Sited (Melissa Bianca Amore and William Stover). The exhibition features works by Richard Artschwager, Henri Chopin, Simone Douglas, Guy Laramée, Jen Mazza,  Kristin McIver, Enrico Isamu Ōyama, Michael Rakowitz, Karen Schiff and Sophie Tottie. These artists, through various mediums, examine the function of the “symbol” and language per se as their primary apparatus. In many ways, these artists return to the ideologies and techniques once employed by the concrete poets, using linguistic fragments or elements as a structural visual form and as a typographical aesthetic. Their work is about the visual and oral histories of knowledge, and the architecture of memory.\r\n\r\nThe renowned American artist Richard Artschwager sculpts words and translates perceptions into tangible objects. A former scientist and furniture maker, Artschwager re-contextualizes everyday objects into letters or punctuations suspended in space, creating new form from traditional visual representations of language. The exclamation point featured in the exhibition represents the arbitrary relationship between form and meaning, and reinstates the artist’s dedication to playfully challenging the preconceived associations in language.\r\n\r\nFrench avant-garde pioneer of concrete and sound poetry Henri Chopin’s series of type-writer poems – or dactylopoèmes - represent the possibilities and significance of conveying meaning through visual symmetries, employing text primarily as a concept to be experienced rather than comprehended. During the 1950s, Chopin began experimenting with everyday sounds by recording vibrations and basic movements, creating a series of sound shapes that investigate the psychological relationship between sound and object.\r\n\r\nAustralian-born artist Simone Douglas’s predominant area of enquiry is with the making of “culture” as a living history and the creation of “language.” Douglas’s work represents the disappearance of oral traditions, storytelling, and the dissolving nature of history and culture. The boat, as a symbolic gesture, emphasizes the mobility of history and the sanctity of oral memories. In the artist’s words, the construction of an ice-ship will serve “as a poetic symbol of reparation - a passionate inducement for considering how we as a nation can go forward.”\r\n\r\nFrench-Canadian artist Guy Laramée retraces the disappearance of the written word by carving and cutting directly into old or used books, creating new topographical landscapes from these discarded pages. Laramée returns to the origin - that is, back to the landscape as a romantic and spiritual gesture. The Grand Library features 80 books from Encyclopedia Britannica and challenges the foundation of knowledge, the work becoming a new “site” of knowledge. Laramée says, “even if the book is dying, even if the paper encyclopedia is gone, the myth of knowledge as an accumulation, the Encyclopedic myth if you like, that myth is far from being dead. We still dream the fiction that knowledge is forever and we dream of keeping it all, all at the same place (be it the web) – and forever.”\r\n\r\nThe focus of American artist Jen Mazza’s paintings is the concept of “translation” – the translation of ideas and knowledge between languages and from one form to another, as well as what is gained or lost in the process.  Mazza sees formal parallels between painting and the book, explaining that “the process of creating the paintings is also a dialogue with form and ideas. Though the finished images are representational, the paintings remain “open,” literally blank, through a great deal of the process.  Each image begins as a near abstraction, the book is reduced to its rectangular form placed so as to be somewhat antagonistic to its support (not unlike Malevich’s White on White) with images and text only appearing later in the process.”\r\n \r\nMulti-disciplinary artist Kristin McIver examines the vocabulary of social media and the ways in which technology has reshaped the mode of exchange and the employment of language. The artist uses devices including light, language and social media to research “identity” ontology and the disappearance of traditional methods of communication. McIver proposes that ideologies served to consumers through traditional and social media, empowered by advancing technologies and driven by market forces, become referents for new models of self-representation. Her work Indebted to you charts the US national debt figure, recorded at the same time of day over a period of 40 days. The number is so capacious as to become abstract and almost incomprehensible; a figure so large it is never fully visible in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese-Italian artist Enrico Isamu Ōyama is inspired by graffiti, particularly the stylized letters of the writer’s signature, otherwise known as the “tag.” Removing the letter shapes, Oyama keeps only the flowing line and repeats it over and over, exploiting its objectness, and thereby creating an abstract motif or a purely visual object. His works are titled “FFIGURATI, a term referring to the word “graffiti” and the Italian expression “figùrati” (literally translated as “figure it out yourself”). Oyama examines the psychology of attaching “a name” to something or someone, and reveals the significance of language as the foundation to the creation of identity and the ego. The exhibition opening will feature a live painting performance by the artist, in the gallery’s courtyard. While a one-time improvisation, the performance will represent the visual idioms and languages the artist has established throughout his practice.\r\n\r\nUsing stone quarried from the ruins of a 6th century sandstone Buddha destroyed by the Taliban in 2001, Michael Rakowitz, with the assistance of stone carvers from Afghanistan and Italy, remade books from the State Library of Hesse-Kassel that were destroyed during bombing by the British Royal Air Force in World War II. For Rakowitz, the “undertaking conjures tombstones and recalls the tradition of stone books serving as surrogates for the illiterate.” The project also underscores the notion that though the physical can be destroyed, beliefs, ideas, and knowledge can never be stopped.\r\n\r\nKaren Schiff is an artist and wordsmith who often combines both the visual and the verbal into new configurations. Schiff’s drawings, paintings, installations, videos, and performances play with sensory dimensions of language and haptic experiences of space. The Agnes Martin Obituary Project drawings are not just a “thank-you letter” to the woman who has been a major motivating factor in her work, but also a tool for unearthing aesthetics of textual spaces. Staring at Martin’s obituary, Schiff noticed the geometry of the article, as “text columns coalesced with image into an elegant whole. The overall composition gave [her] the feeling of a richly populated spaciousness” both like and unlike Martin’s work.\r\n\r\nThe works of Swedish-born artist Sophie Tottie reveal the physical space between things. The artist employs gestures such as drawing, cutting, and erasing, to examine both the physical presence and the conceptual associations attached to the line. Tottie examines the line as a spatial demarcation, as a thinking apparatus, and as the structural foundation of words and ideas. In her series, Written Language, Tottie illustrates through the activity of meticulous repetitive movements the importance of the line, whether understood as a topography or image, composing a conceptual symphony simply through repetition itself. These works resemble the beginnings of mark making, a place or psychological space that existed prior to comprehension as understood today.\r\n\r\nSites of Knowledge addresses critical ideas about history, authorship and visual structures of knowledge. Indirectly, the curators question how we “look” at knowledge and engage with the complexities of our collective history – both imagined and observed. At what point do we begin to attach meaning to a line, a symmetry, and a sound? Knowledge is primarily understood as the basis to knowing, the basis to creating a network of associations and the relationship between memory and history. So, we will continue to ask: what is the “site” of knowledge?\r\n \r\n "

          "The Sylvia Wald and Po Kim Gallery presents Cubic Inception, a solo exhibition of noted New York-based Korean abstract painter Kyung Youl Yoon. The show, featuring some twenty works realized by Yoon in the last two years. \r\n\r\nKyung Youl Yoon was born in Seoul, where he was trained and where he began his career. In the late 1980s Yoon moved to Madrid, Spain, where he continued his studies and was widely exhibited. He has lived and worked in the New York area since 1995.\r\n \r\nYoon began his Cubic Inception series in 2015 as a response both to global climate change and to the alienation of contemporary urban life. Most of all, he began adding sculptural elements to his paintings to “break the indifference of onlookers,” as he has written, “to create an exchange where the viewer begins to […] reflect on a new thought or idea that eliminates obscurity in the forms and creates personal meaning.” Yoon’s depiction of the city, in his words, is composed “of the idea of its components, whether… materialistic goods such as apartments, furniture, [or] phones, or the wide spectrum of thoughts in our minds. It [all] becomes a large matrix of cubes forming a collection of ideas.”\r\n \r\nThe survey of Yoon’s’ recent Cubic Inception works has been organized by Peter Frank, the New York-born, Los Angeles-based critic and curator. Frank notes that the Cubic Inception paintings “extend Yoon’s painterly practice into sculpture, into a low relief of a kind that cannot logically be derived from painting. These thick clusters of aluminum shells, thoroughly covering the Cubic Inception surfaces or interrupted with vast, bottomless swaths of a single color (red, for instance, or a silvery gray that seems to leach from the metal), animate those surfaces with both two-dimensional pattern and three-dimensional texture. Each shape takes the place of a brushstroke. Each edge takes the place of a line. The resulting masses of forms […] strongly suggest aerial views of industrial landscapes, articulated topographies of beautiful but implicitly hostile environments. The Cubic Inception paintings brim with both metaphorical resonance and tactile allure.”\r\n"

        "Description": [
          "Fergus McCaffrey is known for its scholarship of, and advocacy for, artists from the Gutai Art Association (1954–72). The Gutai movement, composed of a group of postwar Japanese artists, reconceived the artist’s relationship between body and matter, creating radically performative work. Rejecting the idea that the artist’s body is absent from a work of art is evident in the meaning of the name Gutai, which translates as “embodiment.” From Kazuo Shiraga’s 1955 Challenging Mud, in which he wrestled in two tons of mud and unset concrete, to Atsuko Tanaka’s 1956 Electric Dress, where she donned a “dress” of hand-painted incandescent bulbs, the emphasis on the artist’s body as a tool in creating a work is vital and evident. The embodied practice of Gutai artists influenced generations of Western performance artists, and the spirit of Gutai still resonates today in contemporary performance art practice.\r\n\r\nREMAINS brings together a diverse group of performance- based artists who, like the artists of the Gutai movement, use their bodies as a tool and a way of effecting change both materially and conceptually. Throughout the course of the show, the gallery will become an evolving site of experimentation by the artists, a laboratory of exploration through embodied actions. The performance artists in REMAINS will transform the Fergus McCaffrey space by working site-specifically to evolve, shift, and change both materials and the environment.\r\n\r\nNigel Rolfe uses finely ground natural minerals to create gestured marks on himself, nearby materials, and the space around him. After the performance, the powder remains, a suggestion of the symbolic dust we all emerge from and to which we all return. The often brightly colored pigments in Rolfe’s work contrast with the rich, dark coffee grounds of Clifford Owens’s scatological marks on paper, referencing the profanity of the body. The motions of his actions can be seen on the surface of the paper and reimagined long after the performance is past. Unlike Owens’s use of paper as a surface on which to make an embodied mark, Liping Ting’s Paper Timing / Stone Timing is marked by the slow action of crawling through a mountain of crumpled paper, with contact microphones amplifying her voice and the sound of her movement. Ting’s ongoing investigation into the interplay between her body and language will layer over time as she marks the windows with texts and symbols during a series of durational performances. Máiréad Delaney’s physically strenuous performances put her in a precarious position; she uses her body as a tool in a form of protest, referencing the body through logs cut with bone saws, the cracked pelvis of a heifer, and long branches of wild thorns. In Hee Ran Lee’s work, 50 Bulbs, the audience members become collaborators in the performance, and they each hold the safety of the artist in their hands when she requests that they swing lightbulbs at her head. The resulting effects—the extinguishing of light, breaking of glass, and puffs of smoke surrounding the artist—make the audience active participants, not passive spectators. Also uniquely engaging the audience, Daniel Neumann’s sound installation, Phase Field, invites the viewer toward the site-specific modified speaker-objects, with the sound growing louder and softer in relation to each person’s physical relationship to the work. \r\n"

          "Vincenzo Agnetti was an innovative participant in the Italian avant-garde from the 1950s through the ’70s, and a prominent member of the artist-run gallery and journal Azimut(h) along with Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni. Agnetti’s work traverses a wide formal range with an analytic rigor matched only by his poetic vision. In examining the depth and progression of the artist’s output, Vincenzo Agnetti: Territories begins to map the development of his artistic and philosophical consciousness. The first solo exhibition of Agnetti in New York in over twenty-five years, Territories, first presented in London earlier this spring, celebrates Lévy Gorvy’s new collaboration with the Archivio Vincenzo Agnetti Milan.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with Territories, the gallery also presents After the Future: The Postwar Italian Avant-Garde, a selection of works that demonstrates the ways in which the Milan-Turin axis served as an epicenter for the gestation and proliferation of ideas in the sphere of emergent international artistic movements. Offering a context for—and in dialogue with—the Agnetti works on view, After the Future includes works by Alighiero Boetti, Alberto Burri, Enrico Castellani, Jannis Kounellis, Piero Manzoni, Giulio Paolini, Giuseppe Penone, Carol Rama, and Gilberto Zorio."

          "“At some point I became aware that my artwork needed in some way to reflect what was going on in the world. Over a period of time I made various attempts at this. Then in 2013, I saw an exhibit of Haitian art at the Museum of Civilization in Quebec. Several beaded Voudou flags were on display, and seeing them I knew that this was the medium I wanted to work in. With this technique I feel as though I am coming pretty close to being able to make a strong social statement, and at the same time create an object of beauty, to be appreciated regardless of the message.” – Nicholas Heller.\r\n\r\nNicholas Heller has written and illustrated several children’s books. He is a woodworker in Portland, Maine. This exhibition in the project room, i.e. the FiveMyles Plus/Space, presents his sequenced and beaded voudou flags for the first time to the public."

          "AMERINGER | McENERY | YOHE presents Speak, America, an exhibition of recent paintings by Guy Yanai. \r\n\r\n“The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.”\r\n\r\nThus begins Vladimir Nabokov’s epic autobiography entitled Speak, Memory. In it the author grapples with emigration, displacement, language, the past, and this brief crack of light nestled within the darkness.\r\n\r\nAfter Nabokov returned to Europe in 1961 (where he lived in the Montreux Palace in Switzerland until his death in 1977) he planned to write a sequel to his autobiography called Speak, America. This project was never realized.\r\n\r\nThis unrealized undertaking—along with Nabokov’s notion of “possessing the past” through memory—has greatly resonated with Yanai. In his second solo exhibition at Ameringer | McEnery | Yohe, Yanai gathers old and new memories. These remain thematically coherent through the artist’s use of fragmented horizontal brushed stripes, with vertical marks being a recent addition.\r\n\r\nThe origins of these paintings are exceedingly varied, their subjects drawn from an ever-expanding archive of photos sent by close friends, iPhone pictures, searched images, and other sources. Some images may lie around for a few years before Yanai decides to transform them into a work.\r\n\r\nIn Fox Hill Road (the street where the artist lived with his family from 1984 to 1989 after leaving Haifa), Yanai combines multiple shots sourced from Google Street View. Worcester, a town forty miles west of Boston, comes from a 2016 New York Times article describing the middle class dreams of the town in the 1950s. Los Angeles is a transcription of a small David Hockney watercolor from 1982, which has bedeviled and obsessed the artist for years. Paris (Rue de Normandie) is derived from an early morning view from the bedroom of the small Parisian apartment of Yanai’s girlfriend, while Brussels depicts a window in the Ixelles neighborhood, which he painted from memory upon his return from the city. The series of potted plants, seemingly detached from a location, are placed by their titles. Hero (For Marie Pierre Chauve) features a plant at the Hotel Regina in Cimiez, Nice—the same type of vegetation that was there when Henri Matisse was a guest. The work is named for the photographer of the source image, who sadly passed away months after taking the picture.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with a thread from the artist’s last show at the gallery, there is one “stacked” painting of seemingly unrelated images: End Of Europe (Siracusa). Placed one on top of the other, they evoke the speech of a child (“and then and then and then…”) yet harbor inarticulate complexities.\r\n\r\nSpeak, America aims to give visible form to three central pillars: experience, memory, and language. This unwritten book serves as a conduit for Yanai to weave in and out of the American psyche.\r\n\r\nGUY YANAI (b. in 1977 in Haifa, Israel) attended Parsons School of Design, the New York Studio School, and the Pont- Aven School of Art. He received a BFA from Hampshire College in Amherst, MA.\r\n\r\nSelected recent solo exhibitions include: “Calm European,” Flatland Gallery, Amsterdam; “Love of Beginnings,” Galerie Derouillon, Paris; “Ordinary Objects,” Haifa Museum of Art; “Fox Hill Road,“ Rod Barton, Brussels; “Ancienne Rive,” Ameringer | McEnery | Yohe; and “Battle, Therapy, Living Room,” The Velan Center for Contemporary Art, Turin.\r\n\r\nSelected recent group exhibitions include “Post Analog Painting II,” The Hole, New York; “Cause the Grass Don’t Grow and the Sky ain’t Blue,“ Praz Delavallade, Paris, curated by Clemence Duchon and Flavie Loizon; “What’s Up,” London, curated by Lawrence van Hagen; “Taste My Brain Drops,” Mindy Solomon Gallery, Miami; “The Ties That Bind,” Achenbach Projects, Dusseldorf; “Bisou Magique,” Galerie Derouillon, Paris, curated by Yundler Brondino Verlag; “Gardening,” Flatland Gallery, Amsterdam; “Mademoiselle Albertine est Partie!,” Appartement, Paris, curated by Timothée Chaillou; and “A House Without Rooms,” Galerie Torri, Paris.\r\n\r\nYanai currently lives and works in Tel Aviv, Israel."

          "The Journal Gallery presents “Summer Sun,” a group exhibition including ten artists whose practice incorporates creating works of a single color. Utilizing the monochrome in different ways, these artists make a case for, and expand on, its persisting relevance post avant-garde.\r\n\r\nImi Knoebel’s sculptural shaped canvases span the chromatic spectrum, breaking down the relationship between form and color, for an experience that is purely abstract. Steven Parrino deliberately restricted his palette affirming, rather than draining, color’s associative properties by imbuing his work with punk subculture and Pop references. Daniel Boccato and Michael Staniak both employ industrial polymers to make physical works that subordinate color to shape and texture respectively. Graham Collins breaks with spatial continuity, bounding and displaying a black monochrome inside a glass vitrine. In Sam Moyer’s stone and dyed canvas work, the single use of color harmonizes the coexistence of naturally occurring and man-made pigment and materials, bridging the accidental and the controlled.\r\n\r\n“Summer Sun” explores the idea of the monochrome as a place of reflection, to which artists continue to return.\r\n\r\nIn coordination with this exhibition, the gallery will present “TENNIS ELBOW,” a project room of weekly rotating solo presentations, opening every Saturday at noon.\r\n "

          "“When I go to art galleries and museums, I feel that artists are, on the whole, dealing with an ‘another’ and wonder why they try to hide themselves in this ‘other.’ Perhaps they feel it is what is expected - the distance. I never considered the aesthetic zing of the personal to be a worthy target. The pursuit of making or enjoying the aesthetic after 300 years of defining itself into a century of bloodless formalism, has resulted in creating the dope of the intelligencia. One goes to a gallery or museum and gets a quick fix, an art high, a cheap thrill, about as profound and instructive as a popsicle and just as enduring.” - Theodore Titolo \r\n\r\nTheodore Titolo studied art from the early 1950s to the late 1960s. He felt his style was never clearly definable and thought he could never find success as an artist, as he didn’t see the work fitting easily into commercial galleries. He obsessed equally over the line drawing, collage, and painting. Always somewhat autobiographical, the work explores his deep yearning to become a hermaphrodite, his homosexuality, his time as a stock broker on Wall Street, the Indian, Tibetan and Southeast Asian tradition of tantric work, Socialism, movie stars, spirituality. \r\n\r\nTitolo has always desired to keep art and money separate, so as to not morph art’s creative purpose. For him, reproductions hold as much value as originals and he often made prints of his own work, which is the only work he would consider selling. For his first gallery show in over 30 years, Shoot The Lobster is presenting a selection of those reproductions, as well as line drawings, collages, paintings, text, and photography.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps my only consistency is curiosity.” - The.\r\n\r\nTheodore Titolo (b. 1928 New York City, NY) lives in Torrington,CT. \r\n\r\n\r\n "

          "MINUS SPACE presents the two-person exhibition Gabriele Evertz / Sanford Wurmfeld: Polychromy.  The exhibition will present new works by two revolutionary New York City-based abstract color painters.\r\n \r\nFor three decades, Gabriele Evertz has examined the “pioneering problem of color” and its transformative effect on the viewer.  In her new paintings, she applies color in spontaneously conceived sequences made in real time at the very moment of painting.  Her paintings continue to employ and expand upon her singular color system of twelve highly-saturated hues, which she juxtaposes against an extensive array of light to dark gray values and metallic pigments.  Evertz’s paintings interweave perfectly plumb, vertical stripes with lines that taper as they reach the top and bottom edges of the canvas, which are nearly impossible to perceive.  The resulting paintings present a barrage of visual information that moves color and form in and out of sequence and symmetry causing the eye to move through undulating, pulsating spaces.  Color and line appear immaterial, filling the viewer with a tremendous sense of aliveness.\r\n \r\nWorking across a wide array of media, from abstract painting to installation to filmmaking, Sanford Wurmfeld has exhaustively investigated the subject of color for more than fifty years through its essential qualities of hue, value, and saturation.  In his paintings, Wurmfeld mixes and modifies colors empirically by eye without relying on any supporting scientific or mathematical system, which he then overlays onto layered grids of shifting alignment.  Wurmfeld believes the perception of color to be a highly subjective experience and he openly embraces differing, individualized responses on the part of the viewer.  He states, “We each bring to the paintings some kind of baggage that is far from universal, and so each of these paintings has a different emotional content.  I mean emotional as an almost visceral response, rather than a feeling you would name with words.  I recognize that it’s there, but I don’t think it’s something that I’m particularly controlling for the viewer.  I’m just creating something that creates a kind of visceral response in me.”\r\n\r\nGabriele Evertz (b. 1945 Berlin, Germany) has exhibited her work in solo and group exhibitions internationally, including in Australia, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States.  Her recent museum exhibitions include MoMA PS1 (NYC), Heckscher Museum (Huntington, NY), Hillwood Art Museum (Brookville, NY), Columbus Museum (Columbus, OH), Patricia &amp; Phillip Frost Art Museum (Miami, FL), Ulrich Museum (Wichita, KS), and Karl Ernst Osthaus Museum (Hagen, Germany).\r\n \r\nHer work is included in many public collections worldwide, such as The British Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Columbus Museum of Art, Harvard University Art Museum, Hunterdon Museum of Art, Karl Ernst Osthaus Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Buenos Aires, Museum of Modern Art, New Jersey State Museum, Parrish Art Museum, Stiftung für Konstruktive und Konkrete Kunst Zurich, Ulrich Museum of Art, Wilhelm Mack Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, among others.  Her work has been reviewed in publications, such as Artcritical, ArtSlant, Hyperallergic, The New Criterion, Village Voice, and Wall Street Journal.\r\n \r\nIn addition to her painting practice, Evertz is a Professor of Art, Painting in Hunter College’s Department of Art &amp; Art History, NYC.  She is a key protagonist in the renowned Hunter Color School, alongside other color painters, including Sanford Wurmfeld, Robert Swain, Vincent Longo, and Doug Ohlson.  Over the past ten years, Evertz has also curated several critically-acclaimed artist retrospectives and surveys of abstract painting at Hunter College, including Visual Sensations: Robert Swain Paintings, 1967-2010; Presentational Painting III; Seeing Red: An International Exhibition of Nonobjective Painting (co-curated with Michael Fehr); Set in Steel: The Sculpture of Antoni Milkowski; and Mac Wells: Light into Being (co-curated with Robert Swain).\r\n \r\nSanford Wurmfeld (b. 1942 in Bronx, NY) has exhibited his work worldwide in solo and group exhibitions since the late 1960s.  In 2013, he was the subject of a major 45-year survey exhibition entitled Sanford Wurmfeld: Color Visions, 1966-2013 curated by William C. Agee at Hunter College/Times Square Gallery, NYC.  He has also presented solo exhibitions at Tibor de Nagy Gallery, Galerie Denise Rene, Susan Caldwell Gallery, Bard College, Maxwell Davidson Gallery (all New York), Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum (Hagen, Germany), Mucsarnok Kunsthalle (Budapest, Hungary), Talbot-Rice Gallery (Edinburgh, Scotland), Neuberger Museum (Purchase, NY), and Ewing Museum Gallery (Knoxville, TN).\r\n \r\nIn 1968, Wurmfeld was the youngest artist included in the landmark exhibition Art of the Real curated by Eugene Goossen at the Museum of Modern Art, NY.  The exhibition traveled for the next two years to the Grand Palais (Paris, France), Kunsthaus (Zurich, Switzerland), and The Tate Gallery (London, England).  Wurmfeld’s other museum group exhibitions include the American Academy of Arts and Letters, National Academy Museum (both New York), Dayton Art Museum (Dayton, OH), Long Beach Museum of Art (Long Beach, CA), Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum (Hagen, Germany), and Espace de l’Art Concret (Mouans-Sartoux, France), among others.\r\n \r\nWurmfeld has lectured and written extensively on the history of color, painting, and abstraction.  He has received awards from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, City University of New York, and Dartmouth College.  Wurmfeld’s work is included in collections worldwide, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Brooklyn Museum (all New York), Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum, Sprengler Museum (both Germany), and Espace de l’Art Concret (France), among others.\r\n \r\nIn addition to his artistic work, Wurmfeld taught in the Department of Art at Hunter College from 1967-2012, where he educated and mentored countless generations of artists.  Originally invited to join the faculty by sculptor Tony Smith and critic Eugene Goossen, Wurmfeld was Chairman of the department from 1978-2006."

          "Arts+Leisure presents Noah Klersfeld’s first project at the gallery, Pillow. Working with surface and depth, color and light, timing and rhythm, Klersfeld creates textural videos, harmonizing multiple time frames that are bound within predetermined structural forms. \r\n\r\nThe five videos in the exhibition reference five programs – Family Ties, Good Times, Who’s the Boss?, All in The Family, and The Facts of Life – with each episode portraying a death in the family. Filmed in the dark, each video shows a close-up of a white, wool pillow that is colored by the light emanating from a television set playing a domestic sitcom from the year 1986. For this series of works, the artist was inspired by the daily ritual of watching TV with his family as a child while his parents were going through a divorce. As Klersfeld describes it, “While we were physically near each other, emotionally we couldn’t have been further apart.” Temporally reconfigured, each video weaves together colors from different scenes into a single frame. The combination of colors is matched by the layered audio that collapses the laugh tracks onto more somber moments of personal reflection.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition installation will feature two U-shaped benches that frame the interactions between the viewers and the work, the viewers and the space, and the viewers with each other. The bench design creates a variety of viewing angles for the work, as well as voids in their centers that signify absence and isolate people’s attention by having them sit together while facing in different directions. The void can be activated, however, depending on how viewers choose to interact with the structure.\r\n \r\nKlersfeld’s work utilizes a complex cutting and layering technique that allows him to bind the surface of the image with the infinite depths of on-screen activity, placing time at the center of his material investigations.  Focusing on the video plane, he is developing what he terms an “operational aesthetic,” challenging realistic still imagery through temporal forms of abstraction.\r\n\r\nNoah Klersfeld is a video artist and architect living and working in New York City, where he currently is a resident artist at The Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts. He earned his BFA and BARCH degrees from the Rhode Island School of Design. His exhibitions and screenings include The Montclair Art Museum (NJ), The Hunterdon Art Museum (NJ), The San Diego Art Institute (CA), The Islip Art Museum (NY), The Museum of Contemporary Photography (IL), The Bronx Museum of The Arts (NY), and The Center on Contemporary Art (WA). He recently completed a long-term video installation at The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) with collaborator Patty Chang and has installed public works in the Toronto subway system (TCC), The Calgary International Airport (YYC), and on the Manhattan Bridge (NY). Noah is a 2016 recipient of the Peter S Reed Foundation grant and his work is in a new book, Media Art and The Urban Environment: Engendering Public Engagement with Urban Ecology."

          "Freight+Volume presents The Secret Life of Plants, a summer group exhibition co-curated by Jennifer Coates and Nick Lawrence. The works in this exhibition explore the relationship between plants, humans, and the psychology behind their interactions.  \r\n\r\nThe Secret Life of Plants was a book published in 1973 that explored plant sentience and the “physical, emotional and spiritual relations between plants and man.” The book begins with the story of a houseplant in the office of a polygraph expert – he hooks the plant up to a lie detector and determines that the plant registers measurable reactions when he intends to harm it. Through years of experiments, he believes he has discovered that plants can read their caretakers’ minds, even from hundreds of miles away.\r\n\r\nThis was later considered New Age magical thinking, however, plants and animals have a complex symbiotic relationship that extends far beyond them supplying us oxygen and food, and us cultivating them and spreading their seeds. Observing plant behavior can teach humans to think, act, and live better. We can learn from paying attention to how they communicate, help each other to grow, and how they find equilibrium in their environments. Climate change is threatening both flora and fauna on this planet, so attuning one’s mind to plants seems like a timely, important ritual.\r\n\r\nPlants make us human. The works in this show delve into the plant/human dialectic and celebrate the psychological spaces that plants help us create. Alexis Rockman’s animals and insects in a liquid, melting landscape and Emilia Olsen’s giant cactus with reclining figure and skeleton hint at the menace of a warming world. David Humphrey and Daniel Heidkamp present a more dreamy, bucolic state of mind amidst vegetation. Meg Lipke and Sangram Majumdar use plants as a vehicle for abstract paint handling. JJ Manford and Jennifer Coates explore a psychedelic vision. Plants get a thorough treatment in a variety of mediums, styles and scales. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition will include works by: Eric Aho, David Baskin, Ross Bleckner, Erik den Breejen, Benjamin Butler, Maria Calandra, Hye Jin Chung, Donna Cleary, Jennifer Coates, Jared Deery, Alec Egan, Stephen Eichhorn, Daniel Heidkamp, Elizabeth Huey, David Humphrey, Peter Hutchinson, Vera lliatova, Samuel Jablon, George Jenne, Mi Ju, Olivia Kaufman-Rovira, Benjamin King, Emily Noelle Lambert, H. Peik Larsen, Meg Lipke, Sangram Majumdar, JJ Manford, Sean Martindale, Cristina de Miguel, Emilia Olsen, Rachel Portesi, Max Razdow, Alexis Rockman, Alexander Ross, Rachel Schmidhofer, Adrienne Elise Tarver, Russell Tyler, Phoebe Washburn, Neil Welliver, and Summer Wheat.

          "Craig F. Starr Gallery presents RYB: Mary Heilmann Paintings, 1975-78. This is the first exhibition in forty years solely focused on Heilmann’s seminal Red, Yellow, Blue paintings from the 1970s.\r\n\r\nInspired as much by Wonder Bread wrappers and Superman as by Piet Mondrian and Barnett Newman, this series is pivotal to the development of Heilmann’s practice. The paintings mark her first use of bright color and the emergence of her characteristically playful style: a mix of formal simplicity and geometric abstraction with personally expressive surface textures.\r\n\r\nRaised in San Francisco and Los Angeles, Heilmann counts California’s surfing culture and the Beats (particularly its impact on music) among her earliest influences. She studied ceramics and sculpture at the University of California, Berkeley, and began painting only after moving to New York in 1968.\r\n\r\nBetween 1974 and 1979, Heilmann made over 50 works using a combination of red, yellow, and blue. Either square or rectangular in format, the paintings were constructed by laying down (mostly) opaque layers of paint and then scraping away one layer from another by use of a squeegee, as in Little Three for Two: Red, Yellow, Blue (1976), or exposing under layers by peeling away tape. The self-referential, process-revealing paintings were thus “built”. As Heilmann explains, “I wasn’t really thinking about painting. I was thinking about structures.”\r\n\r\nAware of her work and its relationship to space and the spectator, Heilmann transformed her paintings into three-dimensional objects by using extra thick stretchers and painting the sides of the canvases. Demonstrating a willingness to push beyond the appearance of perfection, she encouraged the paint to run, goop, and stray beyond borders of the traditional picture plane. As John Yau writes in his essay for the exhibition catalogue, “…Heilmann’s geometric paintings come across as both handmade and homemade. Nothing like them was being made at the time.”\r\n\r\nSimultaneously rebelling against and influenced by Minimalism and Conceptualism, Heilmann pioneered the infusion of abstract painting with craft tradition and pop culture. As Yau suggests “one could say that she confronted the rigid masculinity of large-scale geometric abstractions with a seemingly casual femininity and an unfussy directness that enabled her to bring subjectivity into the domain of geometry.”\r\n \r\nRYB: Mary Heilmann Paintings, 1975-78 is comprised of loans from the artist, the Museum of Modern Art, the JP Morgan Chase Art Collection, the Neuberger Museum of Art, and private collections across the country. It will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue and will include a new essay by John Yau.\r\n\r\nAbout Craig F. Starr Gallery \r\nCraig F.

          "David Zwirner presents Seascape (2017), a new film by James Welling at its 519 West 19th Street location. This will be the United States premiere of the work and the artist’s seventh solo presentation at the gallery.\r\n \r\nIn Seascape, Welling combines his family’s past with the histories of cinema, photography, and painting.  The film is an homage to the artist’s grandfather, William C. Welling, who studied with the American Impressionist painter Wilson Irvine and corresponded with the seascape painter Fredrick Waugh (1861-1940). Using the recently introduced Cine-Kodak Model B 16mm camera, Welling’s grandfather shot the black-and-white reversal footage in the early 1930’s in Ogunquit, Maine, at the suggestion of Waugh. Over the course of two days, he filmed the Atlantic Ocean at Perkins Cove—which was a celebrated site for seascape painters—capturing images of the rocky coast, which he subsequently used as a basis for a 26 x 32 inch oil painting. For Seascape, Welling took digital color samples of his grandfather’s painting and, working with three animators, colorized the original footage using After Effects and Photoshop. The audio component is a contribution from the artist’s brother, William B. Welling, a musician. The sound, which encompasses a slow, continuous progression of three chords with Foley effects, uses a 1940 “Gloria” accordion, as well as two drums—a 1826 Eli Brown replica snare drum made in 1990 with 32 beach pebbles placed on the drum head and a Remo “Ocean Drum.” As a collaborative work between the artist, his grandfather, and his brother, the film, like Welling’s photographic series “Diary/Landscape” (1977-1986) and “Wyeth” (2010-2015), extends the artist’s interest in incorporating autobiographical elements into his work.\r\n "

Each piece of work in this exhibition carries a distinct time stamp of today and includes interactive installations and objects, digital images, video, animation, and digital mixed media. There is no language or aesthetic overlap. From emotionally charged machinima video, manipulated photographs of a near future, finding the soul in obsolete hardware, fantastical wearable devices, to handwritten poems, drawings, and a video chain of single moments, to visualizing emotions of finding one’s home and place in the world, the message always shapes the medium.\r\n \r\nThis exhibition represents a small selection of the many Pratt Digital Arts alumni who are featured in important publications, exhibiting in galleries and new media institutions, and working in major creative industries. Graduates emerge as critically informed and skilled creators actively shaping our digital future. Alumni continue to build on their education to respond to a diverse and networked culture, and to produce experiences that provide audiences agency to explore critical issues. \r\n \r\nFrom Digital and Back is curated by Magdalena Sawon, a contemporary art gallerist and art world figure who founded and owns New York’s Postmasters Gallery. The featured artists include: Jacky Connolly, Takehito Etani, Bryce Grates, Qin Han, Cesar Kuriyama, Dakota Pailes-Friedman, Taezoo Park, and Nick Pedersen.\r\n\r\n"

          "Curated by Rashmi Viswanathan, the group exhibition Silos features works by Ai Makita (Japan), Camila Lamarca (Argentina), Lyoudmila Milanova (Germany), Sara Gassmann (Switzerland), and Conrad Botes (South Africa).\r\n\r\nSilos looks at works that isolate touch, feel, and sense, and psychic experience within contained systems. They explore color and materiality, the limits and contiguities of body and machine, and natural phenomena, in silent, discrete units of reflection.\r\n\r\nThis group exhibition, featuring international artists with Residency Unlimited (RU), explores a range of material possibilities. Whether through figural works that draw one into frame-encapsulated universes, or harnessing multimedia propositions that imprison robust tactility and light and space, the artists draw attention to the discrete life worlds of captured forms.\r\n\r\nRashmi Viswanathan is a New York based curator who writes on colonial-era art and its historiographies and more recent art in and related to the Contemporary. She holds a doctorate in Islamic art history from New York University Institute of Fine Arts and is a PostdoctoralFellow in Global Contemporary Art at the New School University. Having recently curated an exhibition on narrativity for the Princeton University Art Museum, she is currently curator in residence at RU and Alwan for the Arts.\r\n\r\nIn her painterly practice, Ai Makita combines digital and analog methods to express her view of the human world. She creates layers of painted and digital images that are piled on top of each other. Makita is a recipient of 18th. Taro Okamoto Award from Okamoto Taro Museum, 2015 1st. Terrada Art Award in Tokyo, and Art Award Next 2012 in Tokyo. Her works are in the collection of Museum of Tokyo Art University and Takahashi Collection.\r\n\r\nCamila Lamarca uses painting, sculpture, and installation to create scenographic and three-dimensional spaces based in material investigation. Two main axes of research define her practice: the expressive qualities of color and the materiality of objects. Lamarca is the recipient of the Prilidiano Pueyrredón Prize (2014) and the Pintura Felix de Amador Award (2014). She is represented by HILO Galeria in Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nLyoudmila Milanova is a media artist who works across the boundaries of video, installation and performance. She investigates the nature of the process, the gradual change, by those tiny, almost invisible moments of transitions when the standstill turns to movement, the static to the kinetic, or vice versa. Milanova is the recipient of the 2015 Nomination for Villa Aurora grant (LA); 2013 Nomination for Nordrhein-Westfallen Award for young media artists (GR) and 2010 Best of Porsche Award, Filmakademie Baden Württemberg (GR).\r\n\r\nSara Gassmann creates process-oriented paintings, objects and installations which operate on similar principles as when shapes, colors, and materials interact with each other. Her works can be related to poems or music covering a wide range of sounds from “subtle, loud and disturbing dissonances to reflective moods and daytime light situations.” She is the recipient of Swatch Art Peace Hotel Shanghai CN Award (2016) and Art Space Geumcheon Seoul Kr Artist Residency (2015). Her work was recently \\commissioned by Art in Buildings here in New York.\r\n\r\nConrad Botes’ painting, printmaking and sculptural practice is rooted in comic book drawing. He is co-founder with Anton Kannemeyer of the iconoclastic comics magazine Bitterkomix. The narrative content of Botes’ work is usually related to race, gender and violence and their disturbing relationship to power and hierarchy.This biting satire, frequently directed at South African society, politics and religion, is channeled into his practice. His work is in the permanent collection of Museum of Modern Art Print Collection in New York City."

Deliberately creating a new narrative with at first sight unlikely partners or with works with obvious connotations, the exhibition seeks to engage the viewer with the familiar in a new, direct, and unfamiliar way.\r\n\r\nThe show will accompanied by a catalog with an essay by Jonathan Goodman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

          "Pioneer Works presents Grand Ole Opera, a large-scale installation by Tennessee-born artists Willie Stewart and Brent Stewart. Raised by a strong matriarchy, Willie was born into a motorcycle club where all his male influences were indefinitely incarcerated. Brent was raised in a strict Christian household and is a filmmaker. They met in a bar years ago and connected over a shared interest in cinematic space—equal parts B-movies and home video memories. This exhibition, their institutional debut in the United States, also serves as a venue for a related series of noise, metal and rock concerts, staged within a revival tent.\r\n \r\n\r\nGrand Ole Opera Concert Series\r\n\r\nJune 11: Deradoorian at Second Sundays\r\nJune 23: Lightning Bolt with Kill Alters and Twig Harper\r\nJune 24: Black Pus with Burning Star Core and Eartheater\r\nJuly 7: Wolf Eyes with Jackie Lynn of Circuit des Yeux and Dreamcrusher\r\nJuly 9: Unlocking the Truth at Second Sundays \r\nJuly 14: Sleep\r\nJuly 15: Sleep\r\nJuly 19: Fushitsusha\r\nJuly 20: Fushitsusha\r\nJuly 21: Hank Wood and the Hammerheads with Surfbort and Suicide Slide\r\nJuly 28: Puce Mary with Pedestrian Deposit and Bob Bellerue\r\nJuly 29: The Body, Moor Mother, Author &amp; Punisher,and Uniform\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to\r\n\r\nCuratorial Assistant\r\nVivian Chui\r\n\r\nTechnical Direction\r\nJames Clark\r\nJustin Frye\r\n\r\nDesign\r\nDaniel Kent\r\nAllyn Hughes\r\nWill Rhodes\r\n\r\nChief Installers\r\nJulian Townley\r\nJason Grunwald\r\n\r\nMusic Programming\r\nGreg Fox\r\nMarco Orozco\r\n\r\nLighting Design\r\nJoel Fitzpatrick\r\n\r\nElectrical\r\nDaniel Thompson\r\n\r\nInstall Crew &amp; Support\r\nFederico Escalante\r\nAkeem McDermitt\r\nMichael Kelly\r\nJohn McGill\r\nCarlos Perez\r\nVincent Sicilio\r\nWalker Waugh"

          "The Center for Architecture is proud to announce 5x5 Participatory Provocations, an exhibition featuring models by 25 young architecture firms. Curated by Kevin Erickson, Julia van den Hout, and Kyle May, the exhibition argues for participatory criticism and the engagement of architecture in several significant issues we face today: from a growing income gap, immigration, and globalization, to technology’s impact on our lives, surveillance, and power.\r\n\r\nArchitecture as a profession struggles to simultaneously engage with the public and be provocative within the confines of its own field. Either arguments and proposals get “dumbed down” or they simply aren’t accessible or relevant. The avant-garde in architecture has for decades captured the imagination via two-dimensional representations; this exhibition asks architects to be just as provocative in three dimensions.\r\n\r\nIn 5x5 Participatory Provocations, 25 young architects engage a series of popular issues, taking clear stances and producing physical expressions or provocations to communicate with a larger public. Each team responds to one of five prompts — contemplating the future of drone deliveries, the consequences of the construction of extreme luxury high-rises as financial investments, luxury tourism on the moon, the fictional development of NSA community branches, and the potential construction of an anti-immigration wall on the border between the United States and Mexico. The selected topics intend to provoke, but are grounded in issues we face today. Architecture has a seat at each discussion.\r\n\r\n5x5 Participatory Provocations first opened at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in February 2016, and has since been on view at the Cleveland Urban Design Collaborative, the Rhode Island School of Design, and the OMI International Arts Center in Ghent, NY. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPATING FIRMS\r\n\r\nAbruzzo Bodziak Architects (New York, NY)\r\nAndrew Kovacs / Archive of Affinities (Los Angeles, CA)\r\nAnthony Titus Studio (New York, NY)\r\nBrillhart Architecture (Miami, FL)\r\nCarl Lostritto (Providence, RI)\r\nClub Club (Chicago, IL and New York, NY)\r\nDavid Emmons (Urbana, IL)\r\nFormlessfinder (New York, NY)\r\nFuture Expansion (New York, NY)\r\nGELPI Projects (Miami, FL)\r\nis-office (Los Angeles, CA and Milwaukee, WI)\r\nJKURTZ (Cleveland, OH)\r\nKNE studio (New York, NY)\r\nKyle May, Architect (New York, NY)\r\nMichael Abrahamson (Ann Arbor, MI)\r\nNorden (Urbana, IL)\r\nPlatform for Architecture + Research (Los Angeles, CA)\r\nPath + Price Studio (San Francisco, CA)\r\nP.R.O.

          "Curated by Awam Amkpa\r\n\r\nThe artists in this exhibition use lines, motions and emotions to highlight the ways in which structures, patterns and rhythm function as modes of communication and socialization. Their work codifies these artistic processes to produce communities and rituals of identification. These creative productions introduce us to the history and conventions of art making within African and African Diasporic communities. Moreover, the artists blaze their own innovative trails by fashioning these diasporic conventions into art for contemporary audiences.\r\n \r\nFor all the artists, Africa, both as a geographical place and as a font of diaspora, has long served as an energizing if contentious context for producing, mediating, and sustaining art and art making. Their paintings, photography, sculptures, dance, and collages encourage meditation and conversations around the purpose of artistic methods, style, and reception as approaches to belonging.  Together, they inscribe and frame a capacious Africa as subject of art-making all over the Atlantic world.\r\n \r\n"

          "Foley Gallery joins neighboring galleries on Orchard Street for “Gardens on Orchard”, a group exhibition featuring works by Andrew Millner and Martin Klimas.\r\n\r\nHistoric Orchard Street, located on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, is rich with history. Once a literal Orchard belonging to James De Lancey, the street was a lavish garden during the Revolutionary War. By themid 1800’s, the property was divided up into immigrant housing. As settlers relocated to New York City, new businesses opened their doors and remained for many years. “Gardens on Orchard” captures the spirit of those who took risks and focused their energy into making something out of nothing.\r\n\r\nThrough pure experimentation, detailed line drawings or carefully executed explosions, the artists featured in “Gardens on Orchard” use botanical elements in their work. Martin Klimas experiments with the simultaneous state of motion and stillness in his exploding flowers series. The photographs explore the relationship between time,beauty and destruction. In Klimas’ flowers (vases) series, a spring-fired projectile shatters the vase, showing the transformation of a solid object into one that is in between, a temporary sculpture that comes together for a moment, creating a comforting notion that something beautiful can be created out of chaos.\r\n\r\nAndrew Millner investigates the relationship between art and nature – the natural and the made. By usingheavy acrylic medium over digitally illustrated line drawings, Millner traces bouquets of flowers that cross his path, marking time and emotion. The work moves back and forth between the mechanical/general to the hand made and the specific. The titles of the work are taken from specific occasions. The viewer is left with a memory of a bouquet that was once whole, but eventually weathered away.\r\n\r\nGalleries participating in Gardens on Orchard are Foley Gallery, Lesley Heller, Shin Gallery, McKenzie Fine Art, Muriel Guépin and Pablo’s Birthday. All galleries will have receptions on Wednesday, July 12, 6-8pm."

          "Sargent’s Daughters presents Where The Fire Started, an exhibition of paintings by New York based artist Brandi Twilley. This will be Twilley’s second solo show with the gallery.\r\n\r\nIn this series of paintings, Twilley returns to the bedroom of her childhood home, which was destroyed by a fire in 1999. Before the house burned down she made pastel drawings of the bedroom from life that were then lost in the fire. In the year following the fire while her memory was still lucid, Twilley made a series of 16 by 20 inch paintings of the bedroom. Those paintings became her only primary source for the current large-scale paintings since there were no surviving photos of the room, and her 16 year old self became her collaborator. Details such as the cracks in the ceiling plaster, the trees visible through the window and the Picasso reproductions torn from a calendar are specific memories rooted in direct observation.\r\n\r\nIn the bedroom paintings we are immersed in the atmosphere of the house’s decay in the year preceding the fire. The roof is dilapidated and rain soaks the room. A blue plastic tarp, which Twilley slept under during heavy storms, is crumpled on the bed. In “Cat in the Roof,” blood drips down the wall, catching on the warped curves of the paneling above the fireplace. A stray cat and her kittens had been living in the roof above the fireplace and had died, causing maggots to rain down into the fire. In “Plane Crash Survivors” we see, tacked up on the wall, one of Twilley’s first paintings, inspired by a dream of survivors of a plane crash helping each other to reassemble severed body parts. Twilley drew herself standing in front of her bedroom mirror to make studies for the figures and used National Geographics as a reference for the landscape. Picasso’s Blue Period painting “La Vie” was her color reference.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire started Twilley was at school and had with her library books on Picasso and Titian. These books, which she was allowed to keep, ended up being the only remaining items from before the fire. She made copies from their reproductions and they became well-worn paint smudged manuals for learning to paint. The paintings of the library books are done from life, with Twilley painting them propped on her easel. The bedroom was where the fire that destroyed Twilley’s childhood home began, but it was also where Twilley first nurtured her own internal fire, one that sustained instead of consumed.\r\n\r\nBrandi Twilley (b. 1982, Oklahoma City, OK) lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. She received her MFA from Yale University, New Haven, CT in 2011 and has recently exhibited at Hood Gallery, Brooklyn and Kate Werble Gallery, New York, NY. She is a recipient of the 2017 Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program Award. This is her second solo exhibition at Sargent’s Daughters. \r\n \r\n \r\n"

          "Foley Gallery presents “the Exhibition Lab Exhibition”, a group show featuring work by Eva Fazzari, Susan Evans Grove, Amy Montali, Francis Minien, Alex Nelson, David Bernstein, Miles Kerr and Aleya Lehmann Bench.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition Lab is a study of photography outside of a traditional academic setting. The initiative was co-founded by Michael Foley in 2010 as a study center for fine art photography dedicated to learning by critique. Students of the Ex Lab meet over the course of 5 months, holding critique sessions with one another and one-on-one sessions with Michael Foley.\r\n\r\nDavid Bernstein’s images of homes in his adoptive-state of Ohio allow the viewer to experience this landscape as he does; both familiar and foreign. While Bernstein has lived in the Midwest for nearly two-decades, he still feels like a visitor. David’s photographs embrace the emotional distance he feels and allows him to depict his Romantic search for home.\r\n\r\nAmy Montali aims to capture liminal spaces between the ordinary and the heroic. Montali’s work reflects a sustained period of uncertainty – each subject seems both nowhere and anywhere. The proverbial question looms: what now? Using visual and psychological elements in scenarios Amy invents for the camera in real time, she considers her work to be “momentary performances” that are neither portraits nor documents. For each viewer, a new story unfolds.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Montali’s “invented” scenes, Eva Fazzari’s series “From Ashes” documents burnt homes and the people displaced in the aftermath of domestic fires. Fazzari’s images embody stillness and allow for somber reflection. In one of Eva’s portraits, a man and his dog gaze outside a window, the bright sunlight symbolizing hope: a year prior they narrowly escaped a fast moving fire. From Ashes is a story of rebirth, of people uniting and reestablishing a sense of home.\r\n\r\nMiles Kerr produces dream-like images that explore consciousness. His series “Sleep Paralysis” represents a private, subjective and internal reality. Kerr’s work visualizes the mysterious compulsions of our bodies and the way our actuality is created within the brain. By using a fragmented narrative structure, he portrays the state that exists between dreaming and wakefulness wherein a person is unable to speak or to move but can experience the waking world.\r\n\r\nFrancis Minien is focused on objects we actually see every day – things we pay no attention to. Minien photographs everyday items –curtains, walls and vases. These items pass through our acknowledging eyes to our subconscious and are recorded as uneventful, so our attention moves on. Francis believes if you stop your eyes for a moment, and adjust your focus, you may see the color, the light, and the symmetry that makes the everyday beautiful.\r\n\r\nSusan Evans Grove seeks to find the magical in the mundane. Her series “On the Hard” is named after the phrase for a boat out of the water in dry dock, either for repair or winter storage. This is not a natural state for a boat. It is often not the best of times for the boat or its’ Captain. Frailties are exposed but the damage itself is quite beautiful; just as with humankind. Grove records the surfaces of these vessels, revealing the storms these boats have transversed. Like cave paintings etched in their hulls, these images pay tribute\r\nto the power of the sea and remind us we are not in control of nature.\r\n\r\nFor the past seven years Alex Nelson’s central subject has been her family in the wake of her parents’ divorce. In her series “From Here on Out”, Nelson explores how the divorce has shifted her family members’ established roles and interpersonal dynamics. Through both spontaneous and crafted imagery, she records how the dissolution of her nuclear family has affected her parents, brothers and herself over time. At once personally empathic and formally reflective, the photographs intimate tensions to unearth connections.\r\n\r\nAleya Lehmann Bench is a painter turned photographer, and she continues to create art in a similar way. Bench determines form, color, and composition before she begins. In her series “a very costly masque prepared but not shown”, she references contemporaneous descriptions of sixteenth-century theatrical elements. Aleya creates a simple stage that includes a set, props, and costumes. With her camera set to a long exposure, She captures the movement of the figure—pulling the light, color, and form across the picture plane—thereby creating an illusion of motion and, at the same time, one of reverie.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n "

          "The National Exemplar is pleased to announce its new exhibition by Aaron Aujla: “Apartment Alteration Paintings” \r\n \r\n “Apartment Alteration Paintings,” is a continuation of Aaron Aujla’s investigation into the behaviors and furnishings that help define the way we live.\r\n \r\nPreviously, Aujla has transformed a Belgian gallery into a vacation rental for his 2013 exhibition “1BR/1BA on Avenue Louise” in response to AirBnB’s proliferating design ethos. By functionally altering the purpose for visiting the gallery, many passed through the venue without realizing they had just traversed the installation itself, which, by all appearances, reflected a warm inviting place to stay while visiting Brussels. In “Best Judgment,” the artist altered the window treatments of an Upper East Side gallery to mirror a view across the street. By using vinyl shades and sheer fabric supported by a pine board armature replicating the windows across the street, Aujla proposed a sculpture that conveyed two stories, the first being an illusion for the exterior and the other an intervention into the gallery’s interior space. For “Divorce Sculpture,” 2015, Aujla explored how objects hold and transfer emotion. In a discrete gesture of exchange, countertops from home remodeling projects of divorcees were installed in the gallery while exact replicas were reinstalled at the original locations. With “Library Desk At The University Of Punjab,” 2016, the artist hired 10 fiber artisans to employ traditional Indian weaving techniques in recreating carpets produced by factories in India today.\r\n \r\nRecently, the artist has engaged in amateur renovation and restoration projects as an interior designer. Between December 2016 and April 2017, Aujla made alterations to his own apartment based on this exploration, including: a notch in the wall to accommodate a piece of furniture, a pine board closet system, and a bamboo window treatment.\r\n \r\nTaking cues from the work of Walter Gay (1856-1937), Aujla has made oil paintings to serve as a record of these actions. Gay “…proffered several reasons for turning to small-scale interior images. He felt that these works enabled him to be more personal in his art, express his ‘sentiment for the past’ and evoke ‘the spirit of empty rooms.’ “[1] Just as Gay, preferred an antiquated medium to represent his rooms, Aujla borrows from the same tradition, rendering his subtle design acts in oil rather than a more documentarian medium like photography. French-born, London-based artist, Marc Camille Chaimowicz suggests that the preference for an empty room in design publications today is to present a space “…free of occupants…(which) enables the readers the better to project themselves into the range of aspirational fantasies. The exception is that of artists’ homes which invariably feature the artist. It is as though these are seen either as extensions of their work or might in some fashion elucidate insight.”[2]\r\n \r\nThe means that Aujla adopts in his wide-ranging practice extends from photography to text and now to painting. Beginning with a location-based action, each work in “Apartment Alteration Paintings” offers insight into the artist’s most personal investigations to date - 191 Henry Street, NY.\r\n \r\nAaron Aujla (b. 1986, Victoria, Canada) received his BA from the University of Western Ontario, Canada in 2006. His work has been shown internationally at such galleries as CLEARING and Quincaillerie Vander Eycken, Brussels, Belgium; Carlier Gebauer, Berlin, Germany; Paradise Row, London, UK; Art: Concept, Paris, France; Brand New Gallery, Milan, Italy; Cooper Cole, Toronto, Canada; David Peterson Gallery, Minneapolis; Steve Turner Contemporary, Los Angeles; The Journal, Brooklyn; Martos and KA\r\n \r\n[1] Isabel L.

          "RYAN LEE presents Wood Waves, two monumental Hurricane wave triptychs printed on wood by photographer and multimedia artist Clifford Ross. Wood Waves, the artist’s second exhibition at the gallery, is concurrent with Light | Waves, a solo exhibition of Ross’s wood wave triptychs and large-scale Digital Wave installation at Parrish Art Museum on Long Island, New York. Light | Waves will be on view from July 16 through October 15, 2017.\r\n\r\nRoss began the Hurricane series in 1996, marking a shift in his practice towards keenly observing the forms and movements of water. He captured the striking ocean waves by wading into the surf, tethered to shore, during severe storms on the East Coast. The resulting black and white photographs translate the power and dynamism of waves into still images in which the hyperrealistic details of the water often render nature abstract.\r\n\r\nWood Waves further the abstraction of the original Hurricane series by incorporating natural wood grains into the image, while also expanding the possibilities of the photographic print. Ross is perpetually on the forefront of inventing and reinventing both traditional and new media; in the 1990s, he created the highest resolution film camera, the R1, and he continues to develop new printing methods and other technological firsts in the photographic and moving image field. Wood Waves utilize an innovative technique of digitally printing images onto carefully selected panels of maple veneer. In its raw form, wood is a material rarely associated with photography, but here it realizes the tension between water and land. Wood Waves engage the physicality of the triptych, contrasting the texture and pattern of the maple with the foam and spray of the wave to produce an ultimate work that teeters between abstraction and figuration.\r\n\r\nClifford Ross (b. 1952 New York, NY) received his BA in Art and Art History from Yale University in 1974. Following an early career in painting and sculpture, Ross began his photographic work in 1994. He has since been the subject of solo exhibitions at Austin Museum of Art; BRIC House, Brooklyn; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; George Eastman House, Rochester; Guild Hall, East Hampton; MADRE/Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples; and Zhejiang Art Museum, Hangzhou, among others. In 2015, MASS MoCA presented Landscape Seen &amp; Imagined, a mid-career survey of Ross’s large-scale photography and Digital Waves along with the publication of two fully illustrated companion volumes, Hurricane Waves and Seen and Imagined. Ross’s work is held in the public collections of International Center of Photography, New York; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Musée d’Art Moderne, Paris; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, Waltham; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, among others.\r\n\r\nConcurrently on view is Sandy Skoglund: Food Still Lifes (July 12 - August 11).

          "RYAN LEE presents Food Still Lifes, an exhibition of the 1978 photographic series of the same name by Sandy Skoglund. Each of the Food Still Lifes considers the staging and arranging not only of traditional still life compositions but of 70s consumer culture. Though celebrated as early examples of the high-anxiety psychedelic pop tableaux for which Skoglund is best known, the complete series of ten photographs has been exhibited only twice previously.\r\n\r\nEach image in the series depicts a meticulous arrangement of processed food – canned meat or vegetables, marble cake, and cookies – against vividly patterned contact papers. These brightly colored surroundings mimic the patterns of the food itself and fill the frame of the image, creating a dizzying perspectival distortion. In Peas on a Plate, a diamond of green peas sits atop a polka-dotted red plate at the center of the image. The spherical shape of the peas is repeated in the polka dots and the background – a grid of alternating red, black, and yellow squares each with 16 evenly spaced white circles. The resulting scene is a vibrating layering of color and shape that is both whimsical and disconcerting. Luncheonmeat on a Counter presents a sliced slab of meat laid directly onto marbleized contact paper. Simultaneously alluring and repelling, the variegated swirls of the golden contact paper are reflected in the red and pink color variations of the meat. Three images in the series take this perceptual disruption even further. Orange on Box, Yellow Box, and Two Boxes present angled boxes that are covered by the same repetitively patterned design as the backdrops themselves. As the viewer continues to look, the photographs appear to buzz, recede, and emerge.\r\n\r\nSkoglund was drawn to this subject matter by the universality of food consumption (“After all, everyone eats,” she has said) and by her fascination with the commercial food industry’s manipulation of its products and the role photography plays in this. She was struck by the irony that, as the processed food industry continued to expand, human intervention was increasingly required to produce the illusion that these synthetic products were fresh and natural. In a 2008 interview Skoglund explained, “In the medium of commercial photography, the truth of the food is sacrificed for the appearance to the camera, resulting in shiny oily coatings to make something look juicy, and drops of dimethicone to imitate the sweat on a cold glass of freshly poured beer.” This awareness imbues Skoglund’s work with its characteristic combination of familiarity and discomfort, humor and depth, ease and anxiety.\r\n\r\nSandy Skoglund (b. 1946 Weymouth, MA) received her BA from Smith College in 1968 and her MFA from University of Iowa in 1972. Skoglund has exhibited at Art Gallery of Ontario; Aspen Art Museum; Minneapolis Institute of Art; The Morgan Library, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Bordeaux; and Whitney Museum, New York, among others. Her work is held in the permanent collections of Brooklyn Museum of Art; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; High Museum, Atlanta; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Mjellby Museum, Halmstad; Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford; and Yale University Gallery, New Haven, among others. Skoglund’s work has been recently published in Photography: The Definitive Visual History by Tom Ang (DK\r\n￼￼￼￼￼\r\n￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Publishing, 2014) and The Photography Book (Phaidon, 2014). Selected images from Food Still Lifes are included in the Aperture publication Feast for the Eyes: The Story of Food in Photography (Aperture, 2017) as well as an accompanying traveling exhibition of the same name, curated by Susan Bright and Denise Wolff.\r\n\r\n1 Interview between Sandy Skoglund and Luca Panaro, August 2, 2008, in conjunction with an exhibition at the Betta Frigieri Arte Contemporanea, Modena, Italy. Sept. 19, 2008- Nov. 1, 2008.\r\nConcurrently on view is Clifford Ross: Wood Waves (July 12 - August 11). "

          "The National Exemplar presents “Exterior objects for interior use,” an installation of new works by Dean Levin. Pulling from an array of references culled during a recent trip to Japan, Levin presents a rain chain (kusari doi) and bus stop bench, stripped of their use value by being placed in an atypical environment. The rain chain carries historical associations of Eastern outdoor design and irrigation, and the bus stop bench conveys social implications of urban design and public functionality. The former is an alternative to the closed downspouts so commonly seen in Western architecture. The latter is inspired by Shiro Kuramata’s 1983 design for an oft-neglected piece of public furniture. Levin was initially struck by how these forms resonate with Western modernist design and architecture. It’s within this context that he questions the history of modernism, and its longstanding engagement with Eastern traditions. \r\n \r\nA background in architecture informs Levin’s study of space and objects. Through various media, he melds industrial and traditional art materials and techniques. This implicit tension is indicative of his ongoing interest in mechanical reproduction versus the “hand of the artist.” Similarly, Levin deftly expands upon the language of modernism in his work—the grid, seriality, modularity, and the viewer-centric phenomenological experience are all important facets of his practice.\r\n \r\nIn line with this, Levin is interested in how the rain chain consists of links that transport water from a roof to a holding barrel or garden, and in how Kuramata’s bench was designed with three curves and depends on a grid mesh design to distribute weight evenly to prevent buildup of precipitation. Levin designed his own aluminum chains based on drawings, and applied his hand-drawn grid patterns to the aluminum mesh design originated by Kuramata, as well as fashioned the proportions of the bench from the measurements of his body. This brings to bear the vocabulary Levin has developed over the past few years, fusing systems-based patterning with the hand-drawn, and rigorously extends the legacy of modernism, while questioning its origins and inspirations.\r\n \r\nDean Levin (b. 1988 Johannesburg, South Africa) received his Bachelors of Architecture from Pratt Institute Brooklyn, NY in 2012. He will have a solo exhibition at Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York in the fall of 2017, His work has been shown internationally at spaces such as Kohn Gallery and Roberts and Tilton, Los Angeles, CA; Bill Brady Gallery, Kansas City, MO; Luring Augustine, Sean Kelly, Marianne Boesky, New York, NY;  Super Dakota, Brussels, Belgium;  Berthold Pott, Cologne, Germany; Galleria Marta Cervera, Madrid, Spain; Rod Barton and Pippy Houldsworth Gallery, London, UK ; Coma, Sydney, Australia, Fredric Snitzer Gallery, Miami, FL \r\n "

          "In Implicit Borders: a cartography of free will, opening on July 13 at Catinca Tabacaru Gallery, Swiss-born artist Capucine Gros explores how geographical bias permeates body and mind, dauntingly limiting anyone and everyone’s global mobility and consciousness.\r\n\r\nGros traces the symptoms that are embedded in our existence but particularly noticeable in the peculiar strategies (some) humans invented to own the Earth and to quantify human lives: borders, nations, visas, G.D.P. 1, and media attention. The side-effects are indiscriminate, seen far and wide: from a migrant’s interdiction to cross an imaginary line to the common (mis)conceptions of one’s place in the world.\r\n\r\nEven with the best intentions in mind, navigating the world and seeking to contribute to it may not go far until we first come to terms with our implicit bias. The projects in Implicit Borders: a cartography of free will specifically seek to fight geographical prejudice and help to better direct our moral compass.\r\n\r\nThere are exercises, simple in form yet deep in commitment: acknowledging every person we love (The Geography of Love, 2015 – present) and recording every death we learn about (Human Strokes, 2010 – present).\r\n\r\nThere are casual habits, small in constraint, but pervasive in their effect: calling each country by its proper name, widening crop marks, using area-accurate world maps, and counting human beings rather than G.D.P. (Approximately 199, 2012 – present).\r\n\r\nThere are mental leaps to stretch our conscience: imagining we were born somewhere else, or speculating on how different the world would be if everyone (you, me, us, them, teachers, students, politicians, taxpayers, producers, consumers, writers, readers…) envisioned that they cared about someone in every corner of the Earth. Why don’t we, and could we just dream we do so in order to concretely start caring? And how would that change what we say, do, read or buy; where we go and don’t go?\r\n\r\nThere are straightforward questions with not-so-straightforward answers: such as how many countries are in the world?\r\n\r\n195 according to the U.S. Department of State but 193 when counting United Nations member states. 201 if adding states with partial recognition 2; 207 with de facto sovereign states 3 and over 300 if considering micronations and governments in exile. 196 countries ratified the Geneva Conventions and 197 the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. 124 are parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and 197 4 are parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement. There are currently 211 FIFA5 Associations and there were 206 National Olympic Committees in Rio 2016. The ISO 3166 6 has 249 options and there are 259 ccTLDs 7 today. And if one counts passports instead: the number of countries is approximately 199.\r\n\r\nThere are also not-so-straightforward questions with straightforward answers: what makes a better border? Is it a line, coast, mountain, river, tectonic plate, wall, language, culture…? None, truly: they’re all abstract and fluid. How to comprehend big data ? Try counting it. How can we see through our own prejudice? Please, draw a map.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nThe artist will be in the gallery every day at 5pm during the length of the exhibition to work on the on-going, news-based painting Human Strokes (2010 – present).\r\n\r\nDocumentation of the artist’s performance Approximately 199 (March 20 – October 4, 2017) wearing one shirt each day per country in the world can be followed on Instagram @thestudiothatneversleeps\r\n\r\nThe t-shirts are for sale in the gallery in various colors and sizes. Buyers may select their color and size but not the country they purchase. Countries are randomly chosen, reflecting the fact that no one chooses where they are born.\r\n\r\n1 Gross Domestic Product\r\n2 Partial Recognition: officially acknowledged by at least one United Nations Member State\r\n3 De Facto Sovereign States: not recognized by any United Nations Member State but operating independently from the country that claim them\r\n4 197 including the E.U. and the U.S.A. which has announced withdrawal\r\n5 FIFA: Fédération Internationale de Football Association\r\n6 ISO 3166: International Standard for country codes and codes for their subdivisions, typically used in the default drop-down lists of websites across the world\r\n7 ccTLD: Country code top-level domains (two-letter code for Internet domains designating specific countries, states or territories such as .us, .uk or .fr)\r\n"

          "Michael Werner Gallery, New York presents an exhibition of works on paper by Don Van Vliet. The exhibition comprises drawings and paintings on paper from the 1980s through 2000 and is the first solo showing of Van Vliet’s work in New York in 10 years.\r\n\r\nBorn in Glendale, California in 1941, Van Vliet drew and painted constantly as a child and by the age of ten had gained regional notoriety as a prodigious sculptor of life-like animals from clay. Van Vliet continued to draw and paint during his many years performing under the stage name Captain Beefheart. Captain Beefheart, together with his Magic Band, recorded thirteen studio albums of boldly unconventional music and ultimately secured Van Vliet’s place in rock-and-roll history as one of the most original recording artists of all time. Van Vliet turned away from performance in the early 1980s, devoting his intense creative energy solely to painting.\r\n\r\nLike the music he created in the decades prior, the visual works that poured forth from the 1980s until his death in 2010 are bold and edgy and do not fit comfortably into one stylistic category. The artist’s decisive gesture, spare palette and stark, animalistic urgency point to the lore and landscape of the California desert as a primal source of his inspiration. The immediacy of this vision is most keenly felt in the artist’s works on paper. The earliest works on view, executed in watercolor and gouache, are depictions of abstracted nature. Over time Van Vliet gradually shed the painterly, in his later years favoring colored pencil. The late works clearly evoke a sense of primitive sound or language, eschewing the pictorial for pure and unfettered expression.\r\n\r\nDon Van Vliet exhibited his work in galleries and museums throughout the United States and Europe, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Bielefelder Kunstverein, Brighton Museum and Art Gallery, Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art and P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, New York. He is currently included in the exhibition Animal Farm at the Brant Foundation, Greenwich, Connecticut.\r\n"

          "Cristin Tierney Gallery presents Tim Youd: Ecstatic Reading. This is Youd’s first solo exhibition in New York City, and the artist will be performing at the opening.\r\n \r\nFor his New York debut, Youd will continue his 100 Novels project by retyping Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley at the Cristin Tierney Gallery (performance dates and times are listed below). The exhibition will also feature a selection of drawings and works on paper.\r\n \r\nA performance and visual artist, Youd is presently retyping 100 novels over a ten-year period while concurrently compiling a body of related paintings, drawings, and sculptures. During each of his performances, Youd retypes novels on the same make and model typewriter the author used, in a location charged with literary significance specific to the novel. This summer, Youd is retyping four novels in Italy in an “Italian cycle,” which will culminate in his retyping of The Talented Mr. Ripley in New York. This performance will pay tribute to Highsmith’s protagonist Tom Ripley, who escapes his troubles in New York by sailing on an ocean liner to Venice.\r\n \r\nEach book is typed on a single sheet of paper, which is laid on top of a second sheet and run repeatedly through the typewriter. Upon completion, the two sheets are separated and mounted side-by-side as a diptych. They serve as a relic of the performance, containing all of the artist’s keystrokes within the rectangular form of two pages of an open book.\r\n \r\nYoud describes the act of reading as devotional, requiring such total involvement as to make him lose awareness of time, space, and surroundings. Ecstatic Reading derives its name from this altered state of consciousness, and the transcendence experienced by Youd in his performances as he re-types entire novels from beginning to end.\r\n \r\nDiptychs from past performances will be on view in the gallery, and will include Philip K. Dick’s A Scanner Darkly, John Rechy’s City of Night, and Flannery O’Connor’s The Violent Bear It Away, among others. Also on view will be a selection of typewriter drawings. Illustrated by 100 Olivetti Lettera 32s with Tally, the drawings are composed of one hundred accumulated and superimposed outlines of the same model typewriter, with a small index at the bottom logging how many times and on which days Youd drew the image.\r\n \r\nYoud recently retyped another Highsmith novel, Those Who Walk Away, in Venice during the Biennale previews in collaboration with the Hanes Art Gallery at Wake Forest University. He is currently completing John Williams’ Augustus at the Museo dell’Ara Pacis in Rome. These performances are part of an extensive tour of Italy where he will also retype Elizabeth Von Arnim’s The Enchanted April in Portofino and Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms in Stresa. The diptychs created during Youd’s “Italian cycle” will travel, with select drawings and paintings, to the Hanes Art Gallery at Wake Forest University for a solo exhibition in fall 2017. Additional 100 Novels performances will be held in conjunction with an exhibition in 2018 at The Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where Youd will retype multiple novels in a “Hudson Valley cycle.”\r\n \r\nTo date, Youd (b. 1967, Worcester, MA) has retyped 50 novels at various locations in the United States and Europe. He has been in residence at historic writer’s homes, including William Faulkner’s Rowan Oak with the University of Mississippi Art Museum (Oxford, MS), Flannery O’Connor’s Andalusia with SCAD (Milledgeville and Savannah, GA), and Virginia Woolf’s Monk’s House (Rodmell, Sussex). His work has been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions, including the New Orleans Museum of Art, Monterey Museum of Art, Hemingway-Pfeiffer Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, University of Mississippi Art Museum at Rowan Oak, and the Lancaster Museum of Art and History. Youd has presented and performed his 100 Novels project at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) and LAXART, and in January 2017 he finished retyping Joe Orton’s Collected Plays at The Queen’s Theatre with MOCA London. The artist’s work is currently on view at the Hong-Gah Museum in Taipei, Taiwan, where his experimental 9-hour retyping video anchors the exhibition Radical Forms of Writing. He lives and works in Los Angeles.\r\n \r\nPerformance Dates and Times:\r\n \r\nJuly 14, 17-21, and 26-28\r\n11:00 am - 5:00 pm, with a break from 1:00 - 2:00 pm\r\n"
